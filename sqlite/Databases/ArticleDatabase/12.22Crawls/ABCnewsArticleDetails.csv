Kirk on Tuesday touted the fact the event was taking place in person and not virtually, according to the pool producer.; Pence, who leads the White House coronavirus task force, frequently calls on Americans to wear masks and take other measures to stop the spread of coronavirus. But he did not mention those recommendations Tuesday, instead presenting a rosy view of the pandemic, even as it is worsening in Florida and across the country.; ""We're healing America,"" Pence said to a crowd that the pool reporter said exhibited no social distancing. ""And all along the way, like all of you, we've been defending freedom.""; Just days earlier, after receiving a COVID-19 vaccination on Friday, the vice president had implored Americans “to do your part"" to blunt the virus's spread.; “Put the health of your family, your neighbors, and your community first,"" Pence said. ""Practice good hygiene, wash your hands, practice social distancing, or wear a mask whenever it's indicated, or whenever you're unable to practice distance, and listen to your local authorities.”; Rather than participate virtually -- or not at all -- Pence on Tuesday morning took Air Force Two to Florida, with aides, Secret Service agents and members of the press in tow.; His office declined to comment on questions about his participation.; While younger people, like many of those attending the summit, have generally been less likely to experience the more severe symptoms of COVID-19, the virus has spread in the United States to such a degree that large numbers of younger people have still gotten sick and died. Public health experts warn that they can also spread it to older relatives, friends or other associates.; Large, indoor events with little social distancing or mask-wearing can become ""super-spreader events,"" experts have warned.; Florida does not mandate the use of face coverings, although Palm Beach County, where the convention is taking place, does require them in ""all businesses, establishments, and in public spaces.""; The state is experiencing a surge that is nearly as bad as the worst days it saw this summer, averaging over 11,000 new cases and 100 deaths reported each day, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Cases, hospitalizations and deaths are all on the rise.; The average number of daily cases in Florida now is four times higher than it was two months ago. More than 5,500 people are currently hospitalized, the highest number since mid-August.; In his remaining few weeks in office, Pence has held a number of events aimed at burnishing his legacy -- focused on his involvement with the establishment of the U.S. Space Force, fighting against abortion rights, and leading the White House's coronavirus task force.; He has taken steps to be seen as a more responsible leader on coronavirus, compared to President Trump, even as he at the same time continues to participate in activities public health experts have said are dangerous.; While advocating for simple health measures this fall -- such wearing a mask and washing one's hands -- he attended packed campaign rallies in areas across the country experiencing surges, speaking to crowds that often wore few masks.; Pence has stood behind -- and appeared alongside -- Trump even as the president has sown doubt in government scientists and flouted his own administration's safety recommendations.; Just over six months ago, the vice president wrote an op-ed article for the Wall Street Journal titled, ""There isn’t a coronavirus 'second wave.'""; ""I think by Memorial Day weekend we will have this coronavirus epidemic behind us,"" he predicted in April.; ABC News' Arielle Mitropoulos and Ben Stein contributed to this report.","abcnews.go.com","December 22, 2020, 6:28 PM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/urges-caution-covid-19-pence-flies-florida-speak/story?id=74858979"

Fauci said he feels ""extreme confidence"" in the science behind the vaccine and wanted to get vaccinated publicly as a symbol for everyone in the country, as well as protecting him in his work where he sees patients at NIH.; ""I feel extreme confidence in the safety and the efficacy of this vaccine and I want to encourage everyone who has the opportunity to get vaccinated so that we can have a veil of protection over this country, that would end this pandemic,"" he said as he waited for his shot.; Fauci received his shot along with NIH Director Francis Collins and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. They were joined by frontline health care workers at NIH who have been treating COVID-19 patients.; Collins said he chose to get vaccinated to put his money where his mouth is, saying ""bring it on"" as he rolled up his sleeve to get the vaccine he says can end the pandemic.; ""I get to talk a lot about these vaccines and their promise for ending this terrible global pandemic. But it's one thing to hear me talk about it, it's another, to have me roll up my sleeves and say I believe that this is the way we're going to get through this. This is something that the evidence has shown in rigorous scientific analysis to be safe and effective so I'm rolling up my sleeves. And I'm saying, Dr. Bailey. Bring it on,"" Collins said ahead of getting his shot.; He concluded the event by praising the work of NIH scientists who worked on the development of the Moderna vaccine.; ""This Clinical Center has been referred to, for its 67 year history as the house of hope. It's been home to countless medical advances, many in vaccine research. Today represents yet another profoundly significant historical moment for us. It's deeply gratifying to have these halls at NIH. Now take part in the light that's starting to appear at the end of a long dark tunnel called COVID-19. A light made possible by the power of NIH science, and our many partners.""; Fauci said earlier in the day getting vaccinated is a double positive because he both wants to show the importance of getting the vaccine and celebrate the accomplishment of the lab in his division of NIH that worked on developing the Moderna vaccine.; ""It's an important moment. We have worked as you probably know very hard,"" he said in an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""; ""I'll be getting the Moderna vaccine. We just got a shipment in yesterday. I feel very good about it, because in a large part, that vaccine was developed by my group at the NIH. So, you know, it's sort of a double positive. One, in general, I'm doing it because I want to symbolize to people the importance that everyone gets vaccinated who can get vaccinated, but also it's a good feeling of accomplishment because this originated in laboratories in my institute.”","abcnews.go.com","December 22, 2020, 4:16 PM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fauci-receives-vaccine-extremely-confident-effective/story?id=74859728"

Airing Tuesday nights on ABC News Live Prime 7 p.m. ET.; As President Donald Trump prepares to leave office, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are plunging to levels not seen in decades.; ""Our regulations are meaningful. We're seeing reductions in greenhouse gases. And, you know, should we go further? We're going to the extent that the law allows us to go with the agency,"" said outgoing Environmental Protection Agency administrator Andrew Wheeler in an interview with ABC News Live on his agency's four-year track record.; The U.S. is projected to generate 5.9 billion metric tons of emissions in 2020 -- down more than 9% from 2019 and about the same level as in 1983, according to a BloombergNEF study.; Climatologists and environmental advocates say the rosy headline masks a sobering reality: the decline in emissions isn't happening nearly fast enough to stave off catastrophic impacts of a rapidly warming planet.; ""In 2020, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions will be substantially lower than they were in 2019, but that's not because of progress that the Trump administration has made in reducing emissions,"" said Trevor Houser, an energy and climate analyst with the Rhodium Group, a nonpartisan research organization. ""That's because we had the largest economic recession in a generation. So that's not exactly cause for celebration.""; Last year, U.S. carbon pollution slid to the lowest level since 1992, according to EPA.; ""We are certainly doing a lot here in the United States, but you know a lot of the problem with the greenhouse gases is it's a worldwide issue,"" said Wheeler. ""We have problems with China in particular and emissions coming from China and other countries.""; China is the world's biggest polluter, but the U.S. ranks second. And experts say the rate of decline in U.S. carbon emissions has slowed dramatically.; ""Let's be clear. We need to bring carbon emissions down to net zero within a couple of decades, and we need to bring them halfway there within the next decade,"" said Michael Mann, Penn State University climatologist and geophysicist and author of ""The New Climate War."" ""That requires massive action on our part and on the part of every other country in the world.""; In the United States, the impacts of a warming global climate are becoming more apparent. 2020 was the worst fire season the West has ever seen, with more than 5 million acres burned. The Atlantic and Gulf coasts saw a record-breaking 30 named storms.; Scientists say the severe weather events are taking an increasingly destructive toll, in part due to rising temperatures. This year is one of the hottest years on record.; ""COVID-19 is a big problem for the country; the economic situation. But the climate really is right up there beyond any lip service given,"" said Aji Piper, 20, the Washington state climate activist who is one of nearly two dozen young Americans who have been suing the federal government since 2015 for contributing to climate change.; After four years of Trump's hands-off approach to climate, Piper said the harms to his family are only getting worse.; ""My mom has some pretty serious lung issues. And so wildfire smoke and the increased wildfire seasons just put her health at risk in jeopardy, which is personally distressing for me,"" Piper said. ""You don't want to see your parents suffering like that.""; Mann said that while declining U.S. carbon emissions are unquestionably good for the environment, the recent trend is eclipsed by ""four years of tremendous damage"" to climate policy under Trump.; The Trump administration has rolled back major carbon controls, including rules on power plant emissions and methane leaks from oil and gas wells.; The five biggest Trump rule changes combined could add 1.8 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases by 2035 if they're not reversed, according to an analysis by Rhodium Group. That's more than the combined emissions of Germany, Britain and Canada in one year.; ""Those rollbacks combined have already and will continue to reflect in place significantly increase the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere further increasing global temperatures and further raising global sea levels,"" said Houser.; While Trump has cast doubt on the science of climate change, his EPA chief Andrew Wheeler has consistently called it ""a problem,"" but not a crisis.; ""I've always known that as an issue, and it's a problem,"" said Wheeler of climate change. ""You know, taking a look at, for example, some of the modeling, I still think there's some real serious concerns on the modeling on what the impacts should be and when they might hurt.""; President-elect Joe Biden insists the science is clear and that absent ""urgent action,"" the impacts of climate change will become more catastrophic.; The incoming president has vowed to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord on the first day of his administration, and recently named a team of top climate advocates to prioritize his actions.; Former Secretary of State John Kerry will serve as special climate envoy; former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy will become domestic climate czar; and if confirmed by the Senate, North Carolina environmental regulator Michael Regan will succeed Wheeler in leading the EPA.; ""It's clear with the people that he's appointing is sort of a planned agency approach to climate action. It's no longer sort of bottled up in EPA and Department of Energy, but really across the administration,"" Mann said.; Biden plans to push major new investments in renewable energy; ask Congress to set targets to reach net-zero emissions by 2050; and restore more stringent pollution caps, including tighter fuel efficiency standards for new cars and trucks.; ""The good news is that since the election, I'm hearing from lots of the professionals at EPA and they're eager to get going. They're eager to right the wrongs and think they can do it probably much faster than I would have originally thought,"" said Carol Browner, who led the EPA during all eight years of the Clinton administration.; Browner credited more than two dozen states with pursuing clean energy standards despite a lack of initiative on the federal level over the past four years.; ""What you're seeing is elected officials being responsive to their citizens,"" Browner said.; California has led the way, requiring all vehicles sold in the state to get more than 51 miles per gallon by 2026. The rule defies Trump, who set a national standard of just 40 miles per gallon.; The big U.S. automakers are preparing for a big change. ""They know that we're moving to this lower-carbon future,"" said Kristin Dziczek, the vice president of the Center for Automotive Research. ""It will certainly mean greater availability of electric cars.""; ""Biden is seen as somebody who's very pragmatic about these future goals around the environment and climate change and the need to protect American jobs and grow the economy here,"" Dziczek said.; Biden has said his plan would create 10 million new jobs in clean energy. The pandemic has hit the industry hard -- half a million jobs have been eliminated this year so far.; Wheeler said he believes Biden's crackdown on fossil fuels will hurt employment.; ""If we, through government actions to address climate change, force those jobs to close, those jobs are still going to occur, they're going to happen, it's going to happen in China or India or other countries, instead of here,"" he said.; Browner disputed that assessment, saying her record during the Clinton administration is proof that a government-backed transition to renewable energy is a ""job maker.""; ""It's been proven so many times over,"" Browner said. ""We have been successful in making investments in technologies to reduce dangerous pollution. It is not a job killer.""; One open question is how aggressive Biden will be in pursuing his climate agenda, and whether a narrowly divided Congress will go along.; ""I'm not for the green new deal. I am the Democratic Party,"" Biden declared during the 2020 campaign.; The debate is brewing among Democrats, as young activists like Aji Piper promise to keep the pressure on.; ""We haven't seen any real strong action beyond the incremental steps that we have taken. And while those incremental steps are good, they're still just not enough,"" Piper said. ""It feels like going for the long haul, like doing the small things that eventually will affect the large change that we need.""; ""It's not too late now,"" said climatologist Mann, ""to take the actions necessary to keep warming below a truly catastrophic level.""","abcnews.go.com","December 22, 2020, 11:00 AM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-drop-trump-climate-experts/story?id=74848440"
"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/control-senate-puts-georgia-runoffs-national-spotlight/story?id=74848257","Control of the Senate puts Georgia runoffs in national spotlight","The races are bringing Republican and Democratic firepower to the Peach State.","Kendall Karson; Alisa Wiersema","https://abcnews.go.com/author/kendall_karson; https://abcnews.go.com/author/alisa_wiersema","With control of the Senate hanging in the balance, Georgia’s dual runoffs elections in January are taking on outsize influence over the next four years of governing under a newly-elected president.; More than six weeks into the pair of races, which have captured the nation's attention, each party’s heavyweights have hit the stump to gin up their bases, campaign cash continues to flood the state and national forces are shaping the contours of the two contests in the new battleground.; The Democrats -- Jon Ossoff, a once-unsuccessful congressional candidate and investigative journalist, and Rev. Raphael G. Warnock, a prominent Black preacher in the South as the senior pastor of the storied Ebenezer Baptist Church -- are attempting to cement Georgia's status as a swing state by securing the narrowest of majorities in the Senate if they can defeat the two GOP incumbents.; But getting there, much like any other runoff election, will come down to turnout.; ""You all did something extraordinary in November,"" President-elect Joe Biden, the first Democrat to win the state in a presidential election since 1992, said last week while campaigning for Ossoff and Warnock in Atlanta. ""You voted in record numbers. You voted to improve the lives of every Georgian. And you voted as if your life depended on it. Well, guess what? Now you're going to have to do it again come Jan. 5.""; Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris echoed Biden's sentiments on Monday as she hit the campaign trail for Ossoff and Warnock, urging Georgians to think about their votes on a national level.; ""I'm not here to tell you what's in your best interest. But I am here to say that the decision you make, the work you put into this, it will impact people who you may never meet, people who may never know your names,"" Harris said.; For Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, who are campaigning in lockstep, their hopes of retaining their seats rely on an odd quandary: staunchly backing an outgoing president, who refuses to concede his loss, and his false assertions about a stolen election that could hurt their chances next month.; Still, it is Democrats who face a tall order: runoff elections historically favor Republicans, political and election experts told ABC News. But with a wildcard in President Donald Trump, and his assailing of the integrity of the electoral system looming over the race, most aren’t ready to count the Democrats out -- particularly in such close contests.; Politics and religion overlap on the trail; Like many other southern states, Georgia's modern political history developed alongside the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s and was harbored in the leadership of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The link between the past and the present has since been amplified under the national spotlight, particularly in the race between Warnock and Loeffler, despite the four candidates making the strategic decision to run in pairs.; The overlap between political activism and faith-based organizations in Georgia is multifaceted, according to political experts, with each party's base in the Peach State consisting of faith-conscious supporters. In the aftermath of a general election year that saw heightened mobilization from Black voters, community-based organization efforts are likely to play a key role in getting voters to turn out for a second time.; ""For any Republican here in Georgia, getting the white, Evangelical vote [is critical to] getting a big turnout for that group, and for Democrats, it's the African American vote,"" said Dr. Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist and professor at Emory University in Atlanta.; ""The problem Democrats have had is getting African American voters to turn out in runoff elections, but with the national importance of the race, and with Warnock there, I think that that may help them,"" he said.; When polls opened for the first day of early voting for the runoff elections on Dec. 14, turnout for in-person voting eclipsed the total for the first day of early voting in the Nov. 3 election (which landed on Columbus Day, a holiday, leaving some polling locations across the state closed). More than 168,000 voters showed up at the polls, compared to some 128,000 votes for the general election when that total surpassed the previous record set four years earlier by a stunning 42%.; In total, more than 1.4 million votes have already been cast in the runoff elections, according to data compiled by Georgia Votes, including over 41,000 voters who did not participate in the presidential election -- an encouraging sign for Democrats and one that defies the typical trend for runoffs, which often see lower turnout.; In this cycle’s outstanding contests, more than half a century since Dr. King delivered a sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church, Warnock’s association with the church has served up both confidence and tension when it came to establishing his own political brand, while fending off attacks from Loeffler and other high-profile Republicans.; The GOP candidates have sought to cast both Democrats as ""radical"" and tether them to liberal tenets of the Democratic Party, even if both Ossoff and Warnock are running to the middle in a similar fashion as Biden and neither actually supports those policies, such as defunding the police and Medicare-for-All. But the tag team approach between the candidates has allowed the Republican contenders to focus their attacks on Warnock, who was the top vote-getter in his race with Loeffler last month amid a divided Republican field, and his position at the pulpit.; Republicans have frequently invoked Warnock’s record and sermons in an attempt to question the motives behind his policy proposals, repeatedly labeling him a ""radical.""; ""Kelly's opponent is a dangerous extremist who is radically opposed to your values,"" Trump said at a rally in early December, specifically highlighting Warnock in between his efforts to push baseless claims of a ""rigged"" presidential election.; ""He’s used the Bible to justify these types of attacks and make other divisive statements,"" Loeffler said during the sole debate between the two candidates in December.; During the debate, Warnock called Loeffler’s attacks a distraction from giving voters a reason to vote for her. Over the weekend, a coalition of Georgia’s Black pastors criticized Loeffler for her portrait of her rival in an open letter, arguing that it amounts to ""a broader attack against the Black Church and faith traditions for which we stand,"" according to the New York Times.; “My faith is the foundation upon which I have built my life. It guides my service to my community and my country. [Sen. Loeffler’s] attacks on our faith are not just disappointing -- they are hurtful to Black churches across Georgia,” Warnock said in a recent tweet.; The Loeffler campaign did not respond to an ABC News request for comment.; The assault on Warnock — and by association, Ossoff — is a similar playbook Republicans embraced for November that helped them outperform expectations down-ballot. In the weeks since the election, not much has changed for the GOP, with both Perdue and Loeffler using the same tactics to rile up their conservative base.; The strategy on both sides to campaign as virtual running mates is also expected to lead to a singular outcome for the races, experts say, instead of a possible split judgment across the two elections.; ""The vast majority of voters are going to vote straight ticket to vote for both Democrats or for both Republicans, but in a very close race there couldn't be enough [voters] who for some reason split their ticket between the two that you could get a split outcome,"" said Abramowitz.; The Trump factor; But further muddling expectations for the race is the president, who could potentially hamstring his party’s candidates by continuing to make unsubstantiated claims of widespread fraud in the election and sowing doubt about the process.; As Loeffler and Perdue seek to maintain much-needed support from Trump’s loyal base, the two are attempting to convince those voters that while the November election was ""stolen"" from the president, the election will be fair when they vote again in early January. That balancing act could cut against their core ability to motivate the base, if Trump’s supporters don’t trust the system.; ""So many Republicans live and die by what Trump says, and so if he says that the system's not to be trusted, the machines aren't registering the votes properly, then that'll increase the number of people who will believe it. And the logical next step is, OK, so why bother to go vote,"" Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia, previously told ABC News.; Late last week, Loeffler showed no signs of wavering from Trump’s futile crusade to try to hold onto his presidency, still refusing to acknowledge Biden as the incoming president.; ""The President has a right to every legal recourse. That's what's playing out right now. I'm focused on winning this race on Jan. 5,"" she told reporters ahead of the president’s second expected visit to the state on the eve of the runoffs.; The next day, Warnock pounced on his opponent’s unwillingness to both acknowledge the election’s outcome and rule out the possibility of joining a Republican long-shot effort to overturn Biden’s victory when Congress convenes to count the electoral votes on Jan. 6, the day after the runoffs.; ""She's willing to wage war against the voices of the very people she's supposed to be representing,"" Warnock told ABC’s ""The View"" last Thursday. ""Now she's leaving open the option that she would perhaps challenge it in Congress. I think it's undemocratic. It's un-American, and it's unfortunate.""; Still, Republicans are advantaged in the race by history and the anticipated drop-off among Democratic voters that has previously plagued the party’s candidates in the state. Some strategists believe that Republican voters, fully aware of the stakes, won’t ""cut off their noses to spite their faces"" in the overtime elections.; ""It's much more of a pragmatic kind of conservative state. And I think that you're gonna find that a lot of people are not as motivated on the Democrat side as on the Republican side,"" Jay Williams, a Republican consultant in Georgia, said.

The total cost of the package is $2.3 trillion, making it the second-largest economic stimulus in U.S. history.; The chamber split up consideration of the behemoth measure into two votes and approved a slate of funding measures earlier in the evening. Lawmakers then considered the rest of the spending package, which included funding for COVID relief.; This COVID-19 relief bill includes $600 direct payments to most Americans, $300 in enhanced unemployment benefits, $300 billion for the small business loan program, and much more.; Congressional leaders, after several tense months, struck a compromise late Sunday evening.; Trump is expected to sign the bill later this week.; However, because government funding runs out at midnight, lawmakers have also passed a separate stopgap funding bill to avoid a government shutdown for seven days, giving an extra week for the ""enrollment process"" of such a massive bill.; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Monday Americans who qualify for direct payments in the new pandemic relief legislation should expect to see money in their accounts as early as next week.; “The good news is this is a very, very fast way of getting money into the economy. Let me emphasize: people are going to see this money at the beginning of next week,” Mnuchin said in a phone interview with CNBC.; ""The president wanted direct payments, so we will be sending out next week direct deposit,"" Mnuchin said. ""I expect we'll get the money out by the beginning of next week.""; His announcement comes just hours before lawmakers on Capitol Hill were set to vote on a compromise $900 billion COVID-19 stimulus package after months of stalled negotiations.; Top Democrats House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the plan a “package that delivers urgently needed funds to save the lives and livelihoods of the American people as the virus accelerates.” But they both made clear that more needs to be done after President-elect Joe Biden takes office in January.; Mnuchin called direct payments a ""very, very fast way of getting money into the economy.""; ""It's money that gets recirculated in the economy, so people go out and spend this money, and that helps small business and that helps getting more people back to work,"" he said.; The deal also includes $300 in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through mid-March, $25 billion in rental assistance, $15 billion for theaters and other live venues, $82 billion for local schools, colleges, and universities, and $10 billion for child care.; The measure would also provide more than $284 billion for businesses and would revive the Paycheck Protection Program, which expired over the summer.; Mnuchin spoke approvingly of the compromise that was made to get the bill over the finish line.; “This overall bill I think is fabulous,” he said, adding that “this is a large bill and has a little bit of everything in it for everybody.”; The White House has signaled President Trump will sign the bill into law.; ABC News' Benjamin Gittleson contributed to this report.","abcnews.go.com","December 22, 2020, 4:53 AM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pandemic-relief-payments-congress-voting-early-week-mnuchin/story?id=74842477"

'regressing' to stricter COVID measures","His in-person appearance may violate CDC guidelines for quarantining.","Conor Finnegan","https://abcnews.go.com/author/conor_finnegan","Secretary of State Mike Pompeo returned to the office Monday after quarantining because of exposure to someone who tested positive for coronavirus, according to two State Department sources.; His return after less than a week of quarantine may violate guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although it's unclear because little is known about when he was exposed and how often he has been tested.; The State Department has not responded to several questions on the issue since last week.; It also comes as the agency says it is ""regressing"" in its COVID-19 safety plans for the Washington, D.C., area, according to an email from a senior State Department official that was obtained by ABC News.; Because of the virus spreading, its capital-area offices returned to stricter COVID regulations, including ""maximum"" telework, ""mission critical movements only,"" and limits on the ""size of gatherings."" Less than a week ago, the department hosted a holiday reception where hundreds were invited despite CDC guidelines against large indoor gatherings, although Pompeo didn't attend.; ""In accordance with CDC guidelines,"" Pompeo was in quarantine last Wednesday, according to a State Department spokesperson, who said he was ""identified as having come into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID"" -- without specifying when or where.; CDC guidelines say that anyone exposed to coronavirus ""stay home for 14 days after your last contact with a person who has COVID-19."" But that time can be cut down to seven days ""after receiving a negative test result (test must occur on day 5 or later).; The State Department has refused to provide any other details, including when Pompeo was exposed or when he's been tested.; Either way, returning to the office on Monday would not seem to meet that seven-day window. The department's public schedule, posted Monday morning, says he ""attends meetings and briefings, at the Department of State,"" which, according to one source, included some in-person meetings with his staff and with foreign ambassadors.; He has more in-person meetings scheduled for Tuesday, according to the second source, including with Israel's ambassador to the U.S.; Last Tuesday, the department hosted a holiday reception for the families of U.S. diplomats serving in unaccompanied posts, where it's too dangerous to bring spouses or children. An annual tradition for the agency, invitations are usually sent to hundreds of people, while far fewer actually attend because of travel.; Despite the pandemic and the increase in cases in the D.C. area, the agency invited hundreds of people, two State Department sources told ABC News earlier this month. Only dozens of people attended, however, and Pompeo himself did not end up delivering remarks despite a scheduled appearance.; A week prior, State's acting chief of protocol, Cam Henderson, hosted a similar reception for foreign ambassadors, their spouses, and other VIP guests at the presidential guesthouse Blair House. A third reception for foreign ambassadors at the department was canceled last Wednesday.; Together, the series of holiday receptions brought a wave of criticism, including from lawmakers and the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), which called on Pompeo to cancel.; ""It reflects this my-way-or-the-highway approach that has defined his leadership at State, and it's emblematic of his unwillingness to listen to his own advisers, to the experts who are saying this just either isn't a good idea or is against the rules,"" said Brett Bruen, a former State Department official. ""His response always seems to default to, 'I don't care.'""; Less than a week after the unaccompanied tour reception, the department announced Monday that it was re-implementing stricter COVID policies after a rise in cases in the D.C. area.; In an email to staff obtained by ABC News, Under Secretary for Management Brian Bulatao said the department is ""officially regressing to Phase 1"" of its COVID strategy. That means staff travel will be limited to ""mission critical movements only,"" offices are required to allow ""maximum telework"" possible, and visitors and gatherings are to be restricted.; The reimposed restrictions will last until at least January 18, Bulatao said.; In the last month alone, 10 U.S. embassies or consulates around the world have similarly ""regressed"" because of spikes in COVID cases in that country, according to Bulatao's note, while 65% are in Phase 2, where small gatherings are permitted and up to 80 percent of employees can return to work in-person.; The department had moved its D.C. area offices to Phase 2 at the end of July despite concern from some officials as well as AFSA about forcing people back to work too soon.","abcnews.go.com","December 22, 2020, 12:04 AM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pompeo-returns-office-exposure-state-dept-regressing-stricter/story?id=74844795"

His senior White House advisers, who themselves have been alarmed at the ideas the president has discussed, have generally tried to modulate his views.; Trump has contemplated ordering the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to seize states' voting machines and on Friday met with his former national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who has been publicly prodding Trump to declare martial law and order the military to oversee new elections in the battleground states that Trump lost, according to sources familiar with the meeting.; Asked by ABC News whether the president had legal authority to order the seizure of voting machines, Barr at a news conference Monday did not comment on the legality but said he did not currently see a reason to do so.; ""I see no basis now for seizing machines by the federal government, you know, a wholesale seizure of machines by the federal government,"" Barr said.; Trump over the weekend issued a succinct denial of reports he was considering attempting to impose martial law, tweeting early Sunday, ""Martial law = Fake News.""; But just a day before the president met with Flynn in the Oval Office, the former national security adviser told the conservative news outlet Newsmax that Trump ""could take military capabilities and he could place them in those states and basically rerun an election in each of those states.""; Meanwhile, sources said, the president has also considered trying to appoint Sidney Powell, an election lawyer who Trump had cut from his legal team, as a special counsel to look into the 2020 election -- even though the president cannot do so under the auspices of the Justice Department, as would be typical.; Powell has been among the most vocal of Trump's advisers to promote the idea that his 2020 election defeat was actually a mirage, the result of an array of forces that had plotted to steal the election from him. A series of scathing court rulings rejected those claims, as did experts on voting technology.; On Monday, Barr -- who, as attorney general, does have the ability to appoint special counsels -- rejected the idea that one would be necessary to look into the election, or to investigate allegations the president has made Biden's son, Hunter Biden.; ""To the extent that there's an investigation, I think that it's being handled responsibly and professionally, currently within the department,"" Barr said, when asked about Hunter Biden. ""And to this point, I have not seen a reason to appoint a special counsel, and I have no plan to do so before I leave.""; Asked specifically whether he would support making Powell or someone else a special counsel to investigate the election, he said it was not necessary.; ""If I thought a special counsel at this stage was the right tool and was appropriate, I would name one, but I haven't,"" Barr said. ""And I'm not going to.""; Powell joined Trump, Flynn and others in a heated Oval Office meeting Friday night, and she returned to the White House Sunday, although it was unclear with whom she had met or spoken with, according to people familiar with the visits.; She was back at the White House Monday as well for meetings. It was unclear whether she saw Trump.; At the Friday gathering, the assembled group pondered an executive order to seize and examine voting machines across the country, after Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, had initially raised the idea earlier in the week, according to one person.; The White House declined to comment on Powell, Flynn or the schemes Trump is considering to try to overturn the election results.; Meanwhile, after he and his allies lost every legal attempt they launched to overturn the results of last month's election, which Biden won, Trump’s campaign on Sunday said it would petition the Supreme Court to reverse several rulings by Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court and effectively overturn that state’s election results, which Biden won.; The president has not appeared publicly in nine days, and behind closed doors, advisers say, he has remained focused on the election -- rather than governing the country through a historic pandemic, overseeing the rollout of two COVID-19 vaccines and ensuring a smooth transition to a Biden administration.; Even after the Electoral College last week gathered to vote, marking the latest step making Biden's win official, Trump has continued to contest the result.; Both houses of Congress will gather on Jan. 6 to certify the election results, and Trump has been publicly pushing his congressional allies to launch challenges. At most, such moves could delay the formal, final certification of Biden's win by several hours, since doing so would not garner the support of a majority of both chambers -- which would be required to overturn the results.; ABC News' Katherine Faulders, John Santucci, Alexander Mallin, Luke Barr, Matthew Mosk and Olivia Rubin contributed to this report.","abcnews.go.com","December 21, 2020, 9:54 PM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-entertains-desperate-schemes-overturn-election/story?id=74845068"

There's nothing to worry about. I'm looking forward to the second shot,"" Biden said shortly after receiving his vaccination.; ""We owe these folks an awful lot. The scientists and the people who put this together and frontline workers, the people who were the ones who actually did the clinical work, it’s just amazing,"" Biden said. ""We owe you big, we really do.""; Biden's vaccination comes as a second coronavirus vaccine, produced by Moderna, has begun to be distributed across the country, and as the death toll from the virus nears 320,000 Americans.; The president-elect said the Trump administration ""deserves some credit"" for getting the vaccine and distribution off the ground with Operation Warp Speed, but stressed that while the vaccines marked progress, the country needs to continue taking precautions to slow the spread of coronavirus, particularly around the upcoming holidays.; ""I don't want to sound like a sour note here, but I hope people listen to all of the experts and the Dr. Faucis on ... talking about the need to wear masks during this Christmas and New Year's holidays. Wear masks, socially distance. And if you don't have to travel, don't travel. Don't travel. It's really important because we're still in the thick of this,"" Biden said; Biden, 78, had long promised to take the vaccine if advised by Dr. Fauci to do so. In an interview with ABC’s ""Good Morning America"" last week, Fauci recommended Biden receive the vaccine as soon as possible.; ""Dr. Fauci recommends I get the vaccine sooner than later. I want to just make sure we do it by the numbers, and we do it -- but when I do it, you’ll have notice and we’ll do it publicly. Thank you,"" Biden told reporters last Tuesday.; Vice President-elect Harris and her husband, incoming second gentleman Doug Emhoff, are also expected to receive the vaccine at a later date.; ""Consistent with security and medical protocols, the Vice President will not receive the vaccine at the same time as the president. We expect she and Mr. Emhoff will receive their first dose of the vaccine the following week, and we will have additional details on that next week,"" the incoming White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said Friday.; Biden joins several political leaders who have received the vaccine, including Vice President Mike Pence, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and several members of Congress.; One politician yet to take the vaccine is President Donald Trump, who has largely been out of public sight since the two COVID-19 vaccines have received emergency use authorization from the FDA.; White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump was open to taking the vaccine at a press briefing last week, but the president also wanted to prioritize front-line workers and those in long-term care facilities.; Trump is also believed to have some level of immunity from his COVID-19 case this fall. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people who have received a monoclonal antibody cocktail treatment for COVID-19, as the president did in October, are recommended to wait 90 days before getting vaccinated.; ""His doctors, who I've spoken with, wanted people to understand that if you have recently been given monoclonal antibodies, the FDA says you should wait several weeks before you get vaccinated,” U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams told reporters Monday. “So the reason the president has not gotten vaccinated yet is because his doctors have advised him to wait.""; In an interview for ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday, Assistant Secretary for Health Adm. Brett Giroir said it would be beneficial if the president were to receive the COVID-19 vaccine; ""I would encourage the president to get a vaccine for his own health and safety and also to generate more confidence among the people who follow him so closely,"" Giroir said.","abcnews.go.com","December 21, 2020, 9:34 PM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-receives-dose-covid-19-vaccine-worry/story?id=74845208"

""We are building on the important work already underway in the state’s best police departments and establishing a new standard of excellence across the Garden State. But these changes are about more than just reducing unnecessary use of force by law enforcement. We are also restoring the public’s trust in the work we do—which, in the long run, makes law enforcement more effective and everyone safer.""; In an interview with ABC News, Grewal said he was specifically inspired to make the changes after a local newspaper compiled police use-of-force data from around the state, and he wanted to create a database where ""we could and hold officers accountable, accountable if they ran afoul of our rules.""; The new policies will focus on seven principles, including establishing that deadly force should only be used as a ""last resort,"" building on a pre-existing policies that law enforcement officers must use a clear warning and show that ""reasonable"" use of force was justified.; Another principle establishes a ""duty to intervene,"" which states that regardless of rank, an officer has a duty to intervene if they see another officer using any illegal or excessive force.; The previous set of policies was implemented by the attorney general’s office in 2000. Grewal said the reason for the update is that ""a 20-year-old policy doesn't reflect best practices, doesn't reflect who we are as the state, and doesn't reflect our values as a state.""; ""If you look at our 20-year-old policy, it only speaks of use of force. It doesn't even have the word de-escalation,"" he said. ""It doesn't reflect best practices. So, we wanted to create an entirely new framework for law enforcement citizen interactions, one in which, as our policy states, the number one objective before you can talk about using force is how do we preserve the rights and liberties of our residents? How do we preserve their dignity? And how do we uphold the sanctity of human life? That's where we start before we start talking about force and where do we go from there.""; Grewal said the new policy was created with a great deal of input from state and local law enforcement leaders and faith leaders and that the attorney general’s office expects initial statistics from its new database will be available in the first quarter of 2021.; Advocates for the change, including the New Jersey Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that the new policies are a good first step in implementing police reform.; “This framework, if implemented effectively, could serve to avoid tragic outcomes and protect fundamental rights, particularly in Black and brown communities which often are the subject of over-policing,” Amol Sinha, the group's executive director, said in that press release.; Richard Smith, NAACP New Jersey president, said that these reforms are a good place to start on police accountability.; ""Establishing a rigorous statewide policy focused on reducing use of force is an important step forward to achieving police accountability,"" he said. ""We support the guiding principle that officers must make every effort to preserve and protect human life and the safety of all persons and never deploy force in a discriminatory manner.""; Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum whose group helped develop some of the mandatory situational use of force training officers will go through, said that New Jersey's measures are an important step in implementing consistent policing guidelines across the state.; He said it is ""significant"" that the new policy includes Integrating Communications, Assessment, and Tactics (ICAT) training. According to the Police Executive Research Forum’s website ICAT ""is a use-of-force Training Guide designed to fill a critical gap in training police officers in how to respond to volatile situations in which subjects are behaving erratically and often dangerously but do not possess a firearm.""; ""They will be the first one of the first states in the country to train their all New Jersey police ICAT,"" Wexler said.; ""It's not enough to simply put forward new policies, which are very good,"" he added. ""It's also equally important to provide officers with the training that will help them implement those policies. Too many states, too many jurisdictions, simply adopt a new policy with no training. And that can be a recipe for disaster.""; Wexler said that New Jersey could be a model for the country.; ""So, what the New Jersey attorney general is doing is creating consistency in their policies on use of force and additionally providing training that goes with it,"" he said.","abcnews.go.com","December 21, 2020, 7:22 PM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/force-database-established-jersey-attorney-general/story?id=74759101"

It will be another major rescue package for the American people,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor Sunday night. ""For the information of all senators and more importantly for the American people, we can finally report what our nation has needed to hear for a very long time: more help is on the way.""; ""As our citizens continue battling this coronavirus this holiday season, they will not be fighting alone,"" McConnell said. ""Now we need to promptly finalize the text, avoid any last-minute obstacles and cooperate to move this legislation through both chambers.""; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the plan a “package that delivers urgently needed funds to save the lives and livelihoods of the American people as the virus accelerates.” But they both made clear that more needs to be done, and said they would immediately push for more relief after President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.; The final bill text of the agreement is expected to be released on Monday. The $900 billion COVID-19 relief bill will be attached to a must-pass $1.4 omnibus spending bill that funds the government through September 2021. The $2.3 trillion package will be one of the largest spending bills Congress has passed in U.S. history.; The House intends to vote on the package Monday, quickly followed by the Senate.; Both chambers moved late Sunday night to pass a one-day stopgap funding bill to extend the government shutdown deadline through Monday night.; The COVID-19 agreement includes $600 for individuals making up to $75,000 per year, $1,200 for couples making up to $150,000 per year, as well as a $600 payment for each dependent child.; For example, a family of four would receive $2,400 in direct payments.; The bill provides $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through March 14, 2021.; The measure would also provide more than $284 billion for businesses and would revive the Paycheck Protection Program, which expired over the summer. It would expand eligibility under the program for nonprofits, local newspapers and radio and TV broadcasters and allocate $15 billion for performance venues, independent movie theaters and other cultural institutions devastated by the restrictions imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus.; It includes funds for loans from small and minority-owned lenders and directs another $20 billion to small business grants.; The agreement is also expected to provide billions of dollars for testing, tracing and vaccine distribution, as well as $82 billion for colleges and schools, $13 billion in increased nutrition assistance, $7 billion for broadband access and $25 billion in rental assistance.; The agreement is also expected to extend an eviction moratorium set to expire at the end of the year.; The bill also ends the practice of surprise medical billing.; The agreement also includes a tax break for corporate meal expenses lobbied for by the White House.; ""After a long and arduous year, after a year full of bad news, finally we have some good news to dealer to the American people,"" Schumer said. ""Make no mistake about it. This agreement is far from perfect, but it will deliver emergency relief to a nation in the throes of a genuine emergency.""; Schumer emphasized, as he has several times in recent days, that the bill is not robust enough and should be viewed as a ""down payment"" that ""should be viewed as a floor, not a ceiling.""; President-Elect Joe Biden applauded the bipartisan agreement on coronavirus relief legislation in a statement Sunday, saying he is ""heartened"" to see lawmakers from both sides of the aisle come together to hammer out a deal that will help struggling Americans.; But while he applauded the agreement, Biden, as he has throughout the ongoing negotiations, cautioned that his and Congress' work is ""far from over,"" and reiterated the major points of his plan to combat the pandemic and help the economy recover.; ""We need to move immediately to create jobs and build back better than before,"" Biden said in a statement Sunday. ""We cannot do this alone. Immediately, starting in the new year, Congress will need to get to work on support for our COVID-19 plan, for support to struggling families, and investments in jobs and economic recovery. There will be no time to waste.""; The agreement comes as 12 million people are set to lose benefits if pandemic-era provisions to expand unemployment eligibility expire. Millions across the country face eviction if a federal moratorium expires at the end of the year.; All this comes as the rising number of COVID-19 cases are taking a toll on the economy: The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits rose again to 885,000 in the week ending Dec. 12 -- the highest weekly total since September.; Congressional leaders worked through the weekend, but a deal was stalled over disagreements related to the Federal Reserve's lending powers.; GOP Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania was advocating for a provision on the Federal Reserve to be included in the final COVID-19 relief deal. His provision would block the next administration and the Federal Reserve from relaunching several expiring lending programs next year.; Democrats cried foul over the last-minute squabble and accused Republicans of inserting partisan language that would kneecap efforts by the incoming Biden administration to respond to economic crises.; “Right now, Democrats stand together. There was no dissension in the caucus. We cannot make a change like this,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., told reporters Saturday night on Toomey's provision.; ""We keep trying. We're trying, but this is a new thing. And what they've asked for goes way beyond. This is the kind of thing that should have a strong legislative discussion,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said.; Despite the 11th hour haggling, negotiators remained optimistic that a deal would be reached.; A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell confirmed late Saturday night that an agreement had been reached on the Toomey matter.; ""Now that Democrats have agreed to a version of Senator Toomey’s important language, we can begin closing out the rest of the package to deliver much-needed relief to families, workers and businesses,"" McConnell spokesperson Doug Andres said.; Per a Democratic aide, Toomey agreed to drop the language prohibiting the fed from reestablishing lending facilities similar to the ones established in the CARES Act. Republicans also claimed victory, with Toomey's team outlining the compromise as one that prohibits the programs from being duplicated without congressional approval.; Leaders expressed frustration earlier in the week that their negotiations were once again up against a tight deadline.; “I am so frustrated by the inability of us to act like adults, with responsibility,"" House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland said Friday. ""We have a government of 2 million people that are waiting every hour to find out if they are going to be working.""; ""I think McConnell is the principle culprit. But I don't think the rest of us are without blame,"" he said.; McConnell remained upbeat on coronavirus aid talks over the weekend.; ""I appreciate the good faith spirit that has characterized my talks with the Democratic leader, Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, Secretary Mnuchin. But the American people cannot feed their families or pay their bills with Congress' good-faith discussions,"" McConnell said. ""They need us to act.""; The new COVID-19 relief legislation would ""repurpose"" over $400 billion in unused funds from the CARES Act, which Congress passed back in March -- which means this bill will include about $500 billion in new funding if the $900 billion top-line holds.; Democrats acknowledged defeat in getting $160 billion in aid for state and local governments in the deal due to Republican opposition.; At the same time, McConnell has agreed to set aside liability protections for businesses, which he had said was a ""red line"" for Republicans.; Democrats and Republicans alike both fought hard to include direct stimulus checks for Americans at $1,200 -- the same amount approved in the CARES Act by both chambers of Congress in March.; An effort by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., to secure $1,200 direct checks to Americans failed earlier Friday.; Hawley, who had been working with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on a direct check effort for several weeks, left the floor so frustrated that he said he may derail the short-term funding effort to prevent a government shutdown later Friday.; Hawley said he and other rank-and-file members have been left ""in the dark for days"" on what's in the relief package and without assurances that there are direct checks in the package and a package ready to be voted on, he's prepared to stand in the way of efforts to buy a bit more time with a short-term funding bill -- known as a continuing resolution or CR.; ""I have no idea what is going on and I’m not prepared to sign off on a CR until I know what’s going on,"" Hawley said. ""It's beginning to reach the point of absurdity. It's time for leadership to put on the table what they’ve got -- it's time for them to brief members on what they’ve got.""; Hawley called the Senate's predicament a ""self-inflicted wound.""; ""If we are going to spend hundreds of billions of dollars bailing out this, that and the other, surely we could start with reasonable modest relief to the working people in need in this nation,"" Hawley said on the floor.; Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., opposed the measure out of concern that it was ineffective and would drive up debt.","abcnews.go.com","December 21, 2020, 3:36 AM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/lawmakers-reach-covid-19-relief-deal/story?id=74803613"

But Joe Biden I know will have a robust response once we find out the perpetrator and extent of it,"" Granholm said.; Granholm, 61, a former two-term governor and Michigan's first female chief executive, was first elected to lead the state in 2002, after serving as Michigan's attorney general from 1999 to 2003.; If confirmed by the Senate, Granholm would be just the second woman to lead the Energy Department and would be one of 10 women Biden has nominated so far to serve in his Cabinet.; During her time as governor, Granholm oversaw the auto industry bailout and recovery following the financial crisis of 2007 - 2008, working closely with Biden during that time.; Granholm would have a hand in carrying out Biden's proposed climate policy as part of her role as Energy Secretary. That $2 trillion proposal includes moving the country to a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035, and investing heavily in infrastructure and the auto industry.; Granholm argued, as Biden has, that the current climate crisis poses an economic opportunity for the country, allowing the United States to become a leader on production of green energy products in America.; ""We need to be the leader, rather than passive bystanders, or otherwise we're going to allow other countries like China and others we're fighting to be able to corner this market. So Joe Biden's focus has been obviously on climate change, and taking advantage of the economic opportunity for our people to be able to build the products that help America to lead,"" Granholm said.; When pressed by Stephanopoulos on progressives who argue that Biden's plan does not go far enough, Granholm stressed that the administration was undertaking an ""all-in"" strategy which includes input from a number of different groups.; ""The Green New Deal was an important framework for what Joe Biden has put on tap, but I mean really, this is the most robust climate change plan ever,"" Granholm said. ""The fact that he put together this team of people and that it is going to be an effort that runs through government. For example, Pete Buttigieg was nominated this past week. Transportation is going to be a huge component of this, and the input from folks across the political spectrum has made this plan the robust plan that it is.""; ""There's been wonderful input on the part of [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] and Bernie Sanders, but also the business community. I mean, we have an all-in strategy.""; Granholm also expressed her optimism that Biden will deliver on his promise to move the country to net-zero carbon emissions by the year 2050, pointing to the historic nomination of Rep. Deb Haaland, who would be the first Native American to serve in the Cabinet if confirmed to serve as Interior Secretary, as important to making that happen.; ""The Department of Interior oversees a massive amount of public land. That public land could be used to make sure that we generate clean electricity by putting wind turbines, including offshore, as well as onshore, solar panels, et cetera,"" Granholm said.; ""Those jobs and that electricity -- there is going to have to be a significant sort of hair-on-fire effort inside the administration to get it in the ground to meet that goal. And we want to make sure that we are acting in a way that allows us to be a leader across the planet. And so we're gonna hold ourselves accountable,"" she said.","abcnews.go.com","December 20, 2020, 5:27 PM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-administration-robust-climate-change-plan-jennifer-granholm/story?id=74820957"

Mark Warner added that the breach ""may be ongoing""","Adam Kelsey","https://abcnews.go.com/author/adam_kelsey","As United States officials continue to assess the impact of a widespread cyber hack of several federal agencies and large private companies, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee agreed Sunday with the consensus view that Russia was responsible for the attack, and took aim at President Trump for downplaying that assessment.; ""All indications point to Russia,"" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee told ABC Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on ""This Week,"" agreeing with recent claims by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his Republican Intelligence Committee counterpart, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; Warner went on to state that Russia ""came away with a big, big haul,"" but that the government is still analyzing the extent of the attack, saying it will take ""literally weeks to continue to ferret this out and then potentially months to remediate.""; Last week, it was revealed that several U.S. government departments, including Homeland Security, State and Treasury, among others, were the victims of a monthslong cyberattack that began with a breach of software contractor SolarWinds. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency described the intrusion as a ""grave risk to the Federal Government … as well as critical infrastructure entities and other private sector organizations.""; Despite that characterization and expressions of concern from members of Congress, including many Republicans, Trump downplayed the breach in a tweet Saturday, claiming the media is exaggerating the impact and that ""everything is well under control.""; The president additionally cast doubt upon Russia's responsibility for the hack one day after Pompeo stated otherwise, writing that the media is ""petrified of discussing the possibility that it may be China (it may!)."" The secretary told conservative radio host Mark Levin Friday that ""we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity.""; ""When the president of the United States either tries to deflect, or is not willing to call out the adversary as we make this attribution, he is not making our country safer,"" Warner said Sunday.; On ""This Week,"" the senator allowed for the possibility that, despite the discovery of the breach, ""it may be ongoing."" He added that SolarWinds' extensive list of customers across the government allowed for the attackers to work down its ""supply chain"" and ""ultimately get down to some of our most important innovation tools,"" describing the implications as ""extraordinarily serious.""; For now, Warner said ""there's no indication yet [that] classified networks have been breached,"" but noted that ""critical information"" and potentially intellectual property related to cyber defense systems had been stolen from FireEye, the cybersecurity firm that first called attention to the intrusion.; To that point, Stephanopoulos challenged Warner on the U.S.' own international cyber activities, noting that the country engages in similar efforts.; ""How do you respond to those who say this is exactly the kind of thing America does all the time?"" Stephanopoulos asked. ""We attack and we conduct espionage on foreign governments and foreign systems.""; The senator characterized Russia's alleged actions as ""indiscriminate"" in his answer, appearing to indicate that the hack was more extensive than the U.S.' activities.; ""This is as broad and as deep as anything we've ever seen,"" Warner said, adding, ""the idea that that should go unanswered would be very bad American policy"" and could ""invite Russians, or others to continue these kinds of malicious activities.""; As for the federal government's next steps, Warner argued that it needs to evaluate its cyber regulations and potentially implement rules that require private companies to report attacks and intrusions. He further likened the country's digital defense to the military, suggesting priorities shift in the modern age.; ""I sometimes think we disproportionately spend on tanks, ships and guns, when we should be better protecting on cyber,"" the senator said.","abcnews.go.com","December 20, 2020, 4:51 PM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/top-intelligence-democrat-accuses-russia-cyber-hack-resulted/story?id=74820951"

GUSTAVE PERNA, U.S. ARMY MATERIEL COMMAND: Today is another landmark day for our nation.; STEPHANOPOULOS: The Moderna vaccine shipping out right now.; ALEX AZAR, U.S. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY: Trucks will roll, planes will fly this weekend.; DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NIAID DIRECTOR: All of this is sort of bittersweet, because, at the same time as we're moving ahead, we're living through very, very difficult times.; STEPHANOPOULOS: As America endures the pandemic's worst week yet.; DR. DEBORAH BIRX, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR: We can have a party next year at this time. We are so close.; STEPHANOPOULOS: More than 315,000 dead, more than 20 million out of work.; SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): A framework for a major rescue package is very close at hand.; SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): We need to deliver an outcome and deliver it quickly.; STEPHANOPOULOS: Plus: massive cyber attack.; UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This was a very significant effort. We can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this.; STEPHANOPOULOS: Top government agencies targeted, including the Energy Department, responsible for our nuclear weapons stockpile.; SEN. ROB PORTMAN (R-OH): This breach has to be a wakeup call for all of us.; REP. CAROLYN MALONEY (D-NY): The president should be all over it. It should be his first, second, third concern.; STEPHANOPOULOS: We cover all this morning with Admiral Brett Giroir from the White House Task Force, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner, and Biden's nominee to lead the Energy Department, Jennifer Granholm, plus insight and analysis from our powerhouse roundtable.; (END VIDEOTAPE); ANNOUNCER: From ABC News, it's ""This Week.""; Here now, chief anchor George Stephanopoulos.; STEPHANOPOULOS: Good morning, and welcome to ""This Week.""; As we come into Christmas week, the COVID pandemic has tightened its deadly grip on our country. The worst week yet has just passed, crossing 300,000 deaths, a new 9/11 nearly every day, 13 straight days of record high hospitalizations, more than 1.5 million new cases.; One out of every 200 Americans is contracting the virus every day. The good news this week, two vaccines have now been authorized by the FDA. The first shots were administered this week. And the first shipment of the Moderna vaccine is rolling out of the McKesson distribution center in Olive Branch, Mississippi this morning.; Gio Benitez is there, and he starts us off.; Good morning, Gio.; GIO BENITEZ, ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, George, good morning to you.; Yes, just take a look behind me, because you can see those FedEx trucks there pulled up to those loading docks here at the distribution center. They are getting ready to ship those Moderna vaccines.; Take a look at this video from inside the facility, though, because we're getting a look inside that pharmaceutical distributor McKesson. They are handling this monumental effort for Moderna.; We are seeing teams suited up in cold weather gear going into those freezers where the vaccines are kept at negative-four degrees. They are packed and then loaded onto those trucks.; Now, Moderna is shipping nearly six million doses of the vaccine this week. Pfizer is shipping another two million. So, this week alone, in total, we're looking at nearly eight million doses of vaccine getting across the country.; Moderna has a slight shipping advantage here, because this facility is so close to the FedEx world hub, of course, this massive operation happening just after the FDA authorized the Moderna vaccine for people 18 and up. Pfizer is authorized for people as young as 16.; Initial doses will be given to health care workers and long-term facilities, first responders, and those at risk for severe illness.; Now, General Perna of Operation Warp Speed says that they are looking to ship some 20 million doses of vaccine across this country by the end of this month, with much more expected by next year, George.; STEPHANOPOULOS: Right, but, Gio, General Perna has also apologized for misleading the states about how many doses they were going to be getting and when they would be getting them.; BENITEZ: Yes, that's right, George. He is calling this a miscommunication. He is taking full responsibility for it, he says.; And he says this. He says that those initial numbers were forecasts that were ultimately too high. He says he is working hard to correct this, George.; STEPHANOPOULOS: Gio Benitez, thanks very much.; Let's bring in now Admiral Brett Giroir from the White House Coronavirus Task Force.; Admiral Brett Giroir, thanks for joining us again this morning.; Are the states now squared away on the number of doses they're going to be getting and when they will arrive?; ADM. BRETT GIROIR, U.S. ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES: Yes, thanks for having me on.; The states really are squared away. The difference that was talked about by General Perna is, there were some initial projections in November. That was even before we had any vaccine authorized, much less two authorized.; The specific projections for this week were given on Tuesday of last week, and those are on track. And you had them right, two million Pfizer this week, 5.9 million Moderna. They're already on trucks rolling.; STEPHANOPOULOS: I know you hope to have 200 million Moderna doses out by June.; Where do things stand with negotiating more doses on the Pfizer vaccine? And when can we expect other vaccine candidates to be authorized?; GIROIR: So, we are very confident that, by June, anyone in America who wants to have a vaccine will have that opportunity to have a vaccine.; As you know, right now, we have Moderna and Pfizer. The next vaccine that is coming up, which would be J & J or Janssen. We would expect that authorization to be submitted in January.; Again, we don't know the results of that. That has to be unblinded, go through all the processes. It will be very transparent, just like the first two. But we expect that to hit in January.; And again, that is a one-dose vaccine. We don't know the results. But we're very hopeful, by January, we'll have at least three vaccines, with -- with more to come.; And your numbers are right, 20 million vaccine doses distributed at least by the first week in January, approximately another 30 million in January and another 50 million in February, not counting the J&J vaccine.; STEPHANOPOULOS: That June goal is encouraging and ambitious. But as you know, there's still a lot of skepticism out there about the vaccine across the country, especially in the wake of these scattered allergic reactions we've seen, that are being reported.; What should people know about that possibility?; GIROIR: So the system is working exactly as planned. Any time there's any adverse effect, that's immediately reported to the FDA. The CDC investigates.; And right now there are scattered reports. But remember, many of these are tingling in an elevated heart rate. This could be hyperventilation around the vaccine. That does not necessarily mean it's a vaccine problem.; We do believe there was one allergic reaction. We know that is an issue with any vaccine, generally at rates of about one in 500,000 to one in a million.; But we're going to watch these absolutely carefully. They're immediately reported. And if there's any change in the -- in the recommendations, they will come out. The CDC updated their recommendations last night, just to be sure that, if you have an allergic reaction to any vaccine, you probably shouldn't take this one.; But still, it's widely recommended for everyone because we know it's 95 percent effective, as much as 100 percent effective at preventing severe disease. And this is the way we end the pandemic, by getting 70 percent or 80 percent of the American people vaccinated.; STEPHANOPOULOS: We -- we saw Vice President Pence and the surgeon general get the vaccine on Friday, President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris this week as well.; Would it help if President Trump took the vaccine in public?; GIROIR: Well, I think any leader who is influential over groups of individuals should have the vaccine. First of all, I believe everyone at risk or who is very important coming up, obviously the President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris, the president.; But, yes, I think leadership like the vice president, the surgeon general, you know, should get vaccines because they will inspire confidence in -- with the people who believe in them and trust them.; And again, we have every reason to believe that this vaccine, these two vaccines, are very effective and they are safe. So, you know, I would encourage the president to get a vaccine for his own health and safety and also to generate more confidence among the people who follow him so closely.; STEPHANOPOULOS: As you know, a new version of the virus is -- new strain of the virus is out of control in Great Britain right now. They're tightening their lockdown very severely. And several countries have now suspended flights from the United Kingdom.; Is that something the United States is going to have to do?; GIROIR: I really don't believe we need to do that yet. Viruses mutate. We've seen almost 4,000 different mutations among this virus. There is no indication that the mutation right now that they're talking about is overcoming England. I read the British medical journals this morning. It's up to 20 percent of cases in one county. Aside from that, it is very low.; And we don't know that it's more dangerous. And very importantly, we have not seen a single mutation yet that would make it evade the vaccine. Can't say that won't happen in the future. But right now, it looks like the vaccine should cover everything that we see.; So I don't think there should be any reason for alarm right now. We continue to watch. That's what we do. But again, viruses mutate, over 4,000 mutations that we've seen so far in this virus, and it's still acting essentially like COVID-19. And the vaccines should continue to work very robustly against all of these strains.; STEPHANOPOULOS: You know, the dire warnings of a surge upon a surge of COVID cases after Thanksgiving have unfortunately come to pass. With Christmas coming up, what's the most important thing Americans need to know about the virus right now?; GIROIR: The most important thing that Americans need to know is, although we see the end of the pandemic in sight -- and it will end with vaccination widespread in this country -- we have a lot of work to do.; Really, the lives of tens of thousands of Americans depend on what we do. And you know what to do, George. It's wearing a mask when you're in public, physically distancing, washing your hands. If you're having holiday gatherings, please do them safely. Try to limit them to your immediate household. And if you don't, wear masks inside. Improve the ventilation. There are so many ways to do this better.; If you look at the Midwest right now and the Northern plains, they have reversed their very significant outbreak despite the Thanksgiving holidays. Their cases are down. Their hospitalizations are down. Their deaths are down.; That is being counter-balance now by extreme cases in California, some on the GulfCoast, including Tennessee, in the Deep South, and on the East Coast.; But we know what to do. And if Americans do these things, we can flatten the curve and save literally tens of thousands of lives if we do these things before we get the vaccine out. When we get the vaccine out, the pandemic is going to end. This is not forever, but we’ve got a lot of work to do, or it’s going to be even a darker winter.; STEPHANOPOULOS: Admiral Giroir, thanks for your message this morning.; GIROIR: Thank you.; STEPHANOPOULOS: Now to that massive cyberattack targeting the government's top agencies. Dozens of U.S. networks breached including Treasury, State, Homeland Security, and the Department of Energy.; While President Trump downplays the threat, his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called out the Russians, and top Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are calling the attack an act of war that demands retaliation.; Our chief justice correspondent Pierre Thomas has the latest.; Good morning, Pierre.; PIERRE THOMAS, ABC NEWS CHIEF JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: George, the president suggested China might be involved, putting him at odds with his own Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who confirmed the Russian intelligence is the prime suspect. And then you have a statement from Senate Intelligence Committee Acting Chairman Marco Rubio, a Republican, saying it's, quote: Increasingly clear that Russian intelligence created the greatest cyber intrusion in our history.; George, I’ve been covering cyberattacks in the U.S. government for more than 20 years and I’ve never seen anything quite like this. We’re talking not just one agency, but departments across the entire federal government. The Russians are expected of spying on the emails and communications of U.S. government officials and those in private companies.; George, there's deep concern that this is ongoing and the Russians may have the capacity to manipulate and damage computer networks. It's all made worse by the fact that this breach was launched in March and went undetected for months, George.; STEPHANOPOULOS: Yeah. We don’t even know what we don’t know right now.; How could something so sweeping like this happen?; THOMAS: George, there's a company called Solar Winds that makes software products which monitor traffic on computer networks looking for anomalies. It turns that this product is ubiquitous, used by multiple government agencies and many Fortune 500 companies, George. It’s a series situation.; And there's a bunch of questions. How did so many government agencies allow themselves to be dependent on one company's product and why were there so many security requirements for this company that were not apparently followed, George?; STEPHANOPOULOS: OK, Pierre, thanks very much.; Let's get more on this from the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner.; Senator Warner, thanks for joining us this morning.; You know, we saw President Trump downplay the attack yesterday in a tweet, saying it's all under control, that China, not Russia, may be behind it.; Any doubt it was the Russians?; SEN. MARK WARNER (D-VA): I would echo what Secretary Pompeo has said and Marco Rubio has said. All indications point to Russia.; Matter of fact, FireEye, one of the nation's top cybersecurity companies who got hacked, they also indicted Russia. Thank goodness FireEye came forward, because if they had not come forward, we might not have still been able to even discover the attack.; This attack also shows when a nation state brings their best tools to the table, it's very tough for any government agency or company for that matter to keep them out. So, I think this raises a whole host of questions of how did they get in, stay so long, how do we make sure our government agency, for example, CISA, that's supposed to oversee cybersecurity, there's not even a requirement that private companies or for that matter, even public agencies, have to affirmatively report that kind of attack or intrusion to CISA.; We’re going to need to look at a whole new set of rules and, frankly, find ways to align with our allies to prevent this kind of activity from going forward.; STEPHANOPOULOS: And is it under control right now or is it still ongoing?; WARNER: This attack, you mentioned Solar Winds, 18,000 customers, ubiquitous across industry and government, we have narrowed this to companies and agencies that we know the bad guys got in, but they got in and were in for a long time. So, they're very deep.; It may be ongoing. We have not discovered how we will ferret them fully out. And one of the things I think we need to realize is when you get into a supply chain of a -- any product, you can go from one company into another into another and ultimately get down to some of our most important innovation tools being discovered by our adversaries.; This is extraordinarily serious, and when the president of the United States tries to deflect or is not willing to call out the adversary as we make that attribution, he is not making our country safer.; STEPHANOPOULOS: We know this has been going on since at least March. Are we confident our systems weren't breached before that? And what is the goal of this operation? Is it theft and destruction of data, or is it actual intelligence collection?; WARNER: So far the good news is it appears that only the non-classified networks have been breached. There's no indication yet at least that classified networks have been breached, number one.; Number two, the amount of information and the targeting of both -- of companies shows a very, very sophisticated actor. This is classic, you know, obtaining information, critical information, potentially intellectual product. I mentioned FireEye. They stole from FireEye. They've revealed their red team tactics of how they would counter a cyber intrusion. So the adversary very probably, as the secretary of state said, Russia, came away with a big, big haul. And we're still determining how extensive this attack will be. It will take us literally weeks to continue to ferret this out and then potentially months to remediate.; STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Mitt Romney called it the modern equivalent of Russian bombers flying undetected over our entire country.; Is it an act of war? And, if so, how should we retaliate?; WARNER: Well, this is -- I'm not sure I agree with Senator Romney's analogy. This is a very, very sophisticated espionage attempt to take information, key information, potentially of leak (ph) to, frankly, intimidate actual individuals in government, as well as intellectual property. But it begs the fact that we really don't have a set of cyber norms. I sometimes think we disproportionately spend on tanks, ships and guns when we should be better protecting on cyber. And I think not only America but, frankly, our FiveEye partners, NATO, other, because there are international implications of this attack as well. We need to be very, very clear with an affirmative cyber doctrine that says you do this kind of broad-based, indiscriminate attack, you will -- you will bear the consequences.; We don't have those kind of -- those norms out there. We knew back in the 20th century when there were -- you crossed a line militarily, we'll strike back. There was mutually assured destruction with nuclear weapons. This is not the level of an attack that, for example, that Russia took on Ukraine where they were literally trying to shut down systems. But this is in that gray area between espionage and an attack. And I think the only way we're going to be able to counter it is not only better cyber hygiene, better protocols on how information must be shared if you are attacked, and then making very clear to our adversaries that if you take this kind of action, we and others will strike back.; STEPHANOPOULOS: How do you respond to those who say this is exactly the kind of thing America does all the time? We attack and we -- we -- we conduct espionage on foreign governments and foreign systems. We do hacks.; WARNER: The level of indiscriminate attack launch, as Secretary of State Pompeo said, by potentially a Russian spy agency, this is as broad and as deep as anything we've ever seen. And the idea that that should go unanswered would be very bad American policy and, frankly, simply invite Russians or others to continue these kind of malicious activities.; STEPHANOPOULOS: Before I let you go, is this COVID relief deal going to come together today and is it something you can live with?; WARNER: Well, let's -- let's put it like this. I was with Senator Schumer last night in his office until about 11:00. I was glad to see that Senator Toomey accepted Senator Schumer's offer on a compromise. We will preclude three of these facilities from being set up again without congressional approval, what was already the law. We did not think tying the hands of a future Fed or Treasury made any sense. And the great news is, Congress is not going to be the Grinch. We're going to get this package done. And I'm very proud that in many ways this package only came about, George, because a bipartisan group of senators spent a month working hard, showing the American people that we can actually do things when we have such an amazing need.; So folks who are going to run out of unemployment the day after Christmas, or potentially get kicked out of their apartment, or those long lines at the food banks, help is on the way.; STEPHANOPOULOS: Senator Warner, thanks for your time this morning.; WARNER: Thank you, George.; STEPHANOPOULOS: President-elect Joe Biden's pick for energy secretary is up next, plus our powerhouse roundtable.; Stay with us.; (COMMERCIAL BREAK); (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP); PRESIDENT-ELECT JOSEPH R. BIDEN: I nominate Governor Jennifer Granholm. Throughout her career, she's worked with states, cities, business and labor to promote a clean energy future and new jobs, new industry, cleaner and more affordable energy. Now I am asking her to bring that vision and faith in America to the Department of Energy.; STEPHANOPOULOS: President-elect Biden yesterday announcing his pick for energy secretary, the former governor of Michigan, Jennifer Granholm. Governor Granholm joins us now.; Governor, thanks for joining us this morning.; I want to get to a lot about your mission at Energy, but begin with this Solar hack breach, the Solar Winds breach. The Energy Department has been compromised. We know that.; Have you been briefed yet on the scope of the breach? And what will it mean for you and your team as you take control of the department?; JENNIFER GRANHOLM, BIDEN ENERGY SECRETARY NOMINEE AND FORMER MICHIGAN GOV.: Yeah, I mean, I was nominated 16 hours ago, so I have not been briefed on the scope yet.; But I do know that we -- the administration, incoming administration, is taking this extremely seriously. Joe Biden has said that a day one priority is making sure that the country is safe from malicious cyberattacks.; And this goes beyond espionage. It is something that certainly the incoming administration is taking extremely seriously.; However, I would say, George, that we don't -- as Mark Warner just suggested, we don't know fully what happened, the extent of it. And, frankly, we don't know fully for sure who did it. So, the folks who are working around the clock, the civil servants, the investigators, the scientists who are doing the investigation, they have got to be able to come up with the specific answers, so we know what the response will be.; But Joe Biden, I know, will have a robust response, once we find out the perpetrator and the extent of it.; STEPHANOPOULOS: One of the biggest concerns has to be the security and safety of our nuclear weapons stockpile. That is actually -- securing that is the primary job, in many ways, of the Energy Department.; GRANHOLM: That's correct.; The NNSA, the National Nuclear Security Administration, has a responsibility over that. That is a significant piece of what the Department of Energy does. Fortunately, there are serious experts inside of the department who are looking at this right now.; And, as in all things, we are certainly concerned about any secrets being compromised. We haven't gotten that information yet. But, believe me, Joe Biden will have a very significant response. And it may be a multinational response, depending on who is compromised.; If the United States is compromised, there may be other countries compromised as well. We cannot, as a globe, allow this kind of action to happen, certainly as it relates to the most sensitive materials that we have, including our nuclear stockpile.; STEPHANOPOULOS: As you discussed this job with president-elect Biden, how did he describe the mission, what he wants you to do and why he chose you to do it?; GRANHOLM: I am so excited about this, George, because this -- combating climate change is such an economic opportunity for this country.; There's going to be trillions of dollars spent globally on combating climate change by countries around the world. And so, for us as a nation, we have to decide, are we going to get in the game economically? Every country is going to be buying solar panels, and they're going to be buying wind turbines, and they're going to be buying electric vehicles and the batteries, and they're going to upgrade their electric grids.; We could be producing that material, those products here in the United States, and stamping them made in America and exporting them around the country. We need to be the leader, rather than passive bystanders. Or, otherwise, we're going to allow other countries, like China and others who are fighting to be able to corner this market.; So, Joe Biden's focus has been, obviously, on climate change and taking advantage of the economic opportunity for our people to be able to build the products that help the America to lead.; And I will say one other thing. He's very focused as well on making sure that the benefits of fighting climate change, the jobs, are focused on the communities that have been hardest hit by environmental pollution, for example, or that are the poorest communities.; So, both environmental equity, the equity associated with energy opportunity, and creating jobs for Americans, that is going to be the mission of the Department of Energy, in addition to the great work that they already do.; STEPHANOPOULOS: The president-elect says he's going to rejoin the Paris climate agreement on day one, establish a -- quote -- ""enforcement mechanism"" to get to net zero emissions by 2050.; Is that a realistic goal? And what would the enforcement mechanism look like? What it would mean in our daily lives?; GRANHOLM: Well, what it means is, first of all, it is realistic. It is ambitious.; So, for example, yesterday, as part of our team, one of the people who was nominated was Deb Haaland, who is going to be the first Native American who is in the Cabinet, which is awesome.; The Department of Interior oversees a massive amount of public land. That public land could be used to make sure that we generate clean electricity by putting wind -- wind turbines, including offshore, as well as onshore, solar panels, et cetera, that those jobs and that electricity, there is going to have to be a significant sort of hair-on-fire effort inside the administration to get it in the ground to meet that goal.; And we want to make sure that we are acting in a way that allows us to be a leader across the planet. And so we're going to hold ourselves accountable.; And I will say this, too. As a governor, this was something I focused on as governor of Michigan and a lot of governors and mayors are focusing on how they can contribute to make sure that they meet the Paris Climate Accord.; So, we’re going to be working at the Department of Energy with the local and sub-national, as they call it units, the states and the cities, to help give them incentives -- little carrots, little sticks.; The EPA often is the place that people turn to for sticks. But the Department of Energy is going to be working with all of this -- the whole of government effort to make sure we combat climate change in a fair and equitable way, and create jobs in the process.; STEPHANOPOULOS: As you know, many progressives like AOC say it doesn't go far enough. They want to reduce emissions faster and spend trillions more.; What's your message to them?; GRANHOLM: Well, clearly, the Green New Deal was an important framework for what Joe Biden has put on tap.; I mean, really, this is the most robust climate change plan ever. And so -- and the fact that he put together this team of people and that it's going to be an effort that runs through government -- for example, Pete Buttigieg was nominated this past week.; Transportation is going to be a huge component of this and the input from folks across the political spectrum has made this plan the robust plan that it is. If we're going to put charging stations across the country so that people can drive electric vehicles from San Francisco to New York and be able to stop everywhere in between, we want to make sure that our administration is creating that opportunity and those jobs.; So, there's been wonderful input on the part of AOC and Bernie Sanders, but also the business community. I mean, we have an all-in strategy and we're really excited to implement.; STEPHANOPOULOS: Governor Granholm, thanks for your time this morning.; GRANHOLM: You bet.; STEPHANOPOULOS: Nate Silver and the roundtable coming up. We'll be right back.; (COMMERCIAL BREAK); ON SCREEN TEXT: Since 1895, the Senate has voted just once on Christmas Eve. Which bill did they pass in 2009?; The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.; (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP); JOE BIDEN, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (DECEMBER 24, 2009): The yeas are 60, the nays are 39. HR-3590, as amended, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is passed.; (END VIDEO CLIP); GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS CHIEF ANCHOR: The roundtable is ready to go.; We'll be right back.; (COMMERCIAL BREAK); (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP); JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT FOR THE UNITED STATES: I think Georgia is going to shock the nation with the number of people who vote on January the 5th.; I need two senators from this state who want to get something done, not two senators are who just going to get in the way.; MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We need two senators that will get in the way of the radical agenda of the Democratic Party and fight for Georgia every single day.; (END VIDEO CLIP); STEPHANOPOULOS: The battle for Georgia and control of the Senate heading into the home stretch. President Trump announced last night that he's going to headline a rally on election eve, but are his false attacks and conspiracy theories about his own loss hurting the GOP Senate candidates.; Here's Nate Silver's take.; (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE); NATE SILVER, FIVETHIRTYEIGHT: Georgia is one state where the polls were fairly accurate on Election Day.; So as polls again show a close race in these two Georgia Senate runoffs, it's worth looking at them seriously as the campaign intensifies.; FiveThirtyEight polling averages have Republican David Perdue pretty much tied with Democrat Jon Ossoff for the regular Georgia seat. And the same is true between Democrat Raphael Warnock and Republican Kelly Loeffler for the special Georgia seat.; There is something more subtle going on here, though. Perdue and Loeffler have actually gained a bit of ground in polls, closing in on earlier Democratic leads. That may be due to a shift away from President Trump's rhetoric as he's been questioning the validity of the election and refusing to concede; Polling shows two-thirds of Republicans agree with Trump's bogus claims that the election wasn't fair. And officials are concerned that, if their voters think elections are rigged, they may figure, ""Hey, why bother to turn up at all?""; Recent Republican rhetoric has tried to pivot, though, by implicitly or even explicitly acknowledging Joe Biden's victory. Mike Pence, for example, in a rally this week, spoke of Georgia as being ""the last line of defense for the GOP,"" which concedes there will be a Democratic House and a Democratic president.; And historically, when a new party takes over the White House, voters want balanced government. We usually see what we call a midterm penalty that punishes the president's party by around five percentage points.; So I buy that Trump's refusal to concede has not made life any easier on the GOP. But with the electoral college declaring Biden the winner this week and with GOP leaders like Mitch McConnell acknowledging Biden's win, this may now be a bit less of an issue.; (END VIDEOTAPE); STEPHANOPOULOS: Thanks to Nate. Our roundtable's up next. We'll be right back.; (COMMERCIAL BREAK); (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP); SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, (R) KENTUCKY, AND MAJORITY LEADER: Many millions of us had hoped the presidential election would yield a different result. The electoral college has spoken. So today I want to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden.; (END VIDEO CLIP); (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP); PRESIDENT-ELECT JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR: I had a good conversation with Mitch McConnell today. (inaudible) so I called him to thank him for the congratulations. I told him, although we disagree on a lot of things, there's things we can work together on.; (END VIDEO CLIP); STEPHANOPOULOS: It was a long time coming, but after the electoral college voted this week, Joe Biden and Mitch McConnell did have their first conversation since the election.; Let's talk about what that all means now on our roundtable, joined by Chris Christie, Rahm Emanuel, the CEO for Democracy for America Yvette Simpson and Republican strategist Sara Fagen.; And, Rahm, let me begin with you. Some good words there from both the president-elect and Leader McConnell. But what realistically can be achieved?; RAHM EMANUEL, (D) FORMER CHICAGO MAYOR AND ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I mean, that's -- also deals with what's -- George, I think a lot can be achieved. And I think one of the things that you saw this week is that the moderate Republicans and Democrats who came together created the space for what looks like a -- they're going to have a $900 billion pandemic relief bill in that place.; And I think that, in that area, whether it's on minimum wage, whether it's on, obviously, rural broadband, whether it's on -- like they're about to pass, it looks like, in this bill -- or in the omnibus bill -- also an end to surprise medical billing.; There's a lot of things that can get done. And I think that's the focus of where the -- President Biden's going to be.; And I do think it's interesting that both President Biden and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell know each other by first name. They know how to work with each other.; And I think, given that the country -- not only is both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue divided -- and one end is definitely divided -- the other piece is it's divided down the middle, which means that the agenda has to focus in that way because you're not going to be able to break on either extreme, which will snap the entire process.; STEPHANOPOULOS: And Sara Fagen, obviously what happens in the Georgia race is going to make a difference. It's either the majority one vote -- one way or the other. But even with that -- and that can make a big difference on things like judicial appointments -- but even with that, it still does mean the center of gravity in the Senate, no matter what, is going to be, as Rahm was saying, with the most conservative Democrats, the most moderate Republicans.; SARA FAGEN, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah, I think that's right. And I think the fact that these senators came together to get what we think will be a pandemic relief bill done here in a few hours is a positive sign in moving the country past some of the most partisan gridlock.; But these challenges are going to remain. The country is very deeply divided. We see it playing out in Georgia, where it's an incredibly close election, and where many, many Trump voters, 70 million, a big percentage of them still are upset about this election and think that something, some wrongdoing was done and the president may, in fact, have won.; So, that remains a huge challenge and hurdle for the Senate as we get into this next administration.; STEPHANOPOULOS: And, Chris Christie, talk about that.; We saw the president put out that tweet last night saying he's going to go to Georgia in the final days before the election. Yet he continues to attack the state's -- the state's leaders.; Is there a way he can thread the needle here, or does he want to?; CHRIS CHRISTIE, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, the question, George, is, of course, there's always a way to thread the needle. The real question is, does he want to?; And I don't think he's shown any indication that he does. I would suspect that you're going to see a very similar performance at the rally that he will hold the night before the election as he gave the last time that he was in Georgia.; and how that will play out, I don't think anybody knows. There's certainly no question that there's going to be a large number of voters in Georgia who the president's appearance will motivate. And that will be good for Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue.; I don't know what impact the president's language on the election and the validity of the election is having down there. We probably won't know until after election day on January 5 in Georgia.; But it's not a question of whether the needle can be thread. It could be, if he wanted it to, but I don't know that he wants to. I certainly haven't seen any indication publicly that he's -- that he's pivoting off of that message.; STEPHANOPOULOS: Yvette Simpson, the question for Democrats is, how do they keep their enthusiasm high now that Donald Trump is leaving office?; YVETTE SIMPSON, ABC NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think part of what we're seeing in Georgia is an indication of that.; I think you have got a lot of energy. Organizers are leading the way down there in Georgia. We have a lot of establishment folks outside and in the Beltway following the lead of these organizers.; You have seen record turnout in the first couple days of early vote, record registrations. And I think part of that, hopefully, will lead to the Democrats understanding that we're better and stronger when we all work together.; I, unfortunately, am not pleased with the bill that was negotiated, for a lot of reasons. And I think you're going to hear progressives talk about the fact that that $600 payment is just not enough as we go into January. It is lower than the median rent in most states, if not all across the country.; And so I think the real question going forward, George, is, who will the Biden White House serve? Will they serve people first or will they serve special interests? And I think there's still a lot to be seen as we continue to fill out these positions, as we continue to see what the balance of power is going to look like going forward in the Senate.; EMANUEL: George...; STEPHANOPOULOS: Rahm Emanuel, what's the answer to that?; EMANUEL: Well, two -- one -- two things I want to pick up on, one thing on what Governor Christie said.; I actually think there's a division here between Mitch McConnell's interests and Donald Trump's interests. Mitch McConnell obviously needs, as does Joe Biden for different reasons, Georgia to fall one way, towards the Republicans. Joe Biden obviously needs it to fall to the Democrats, so the Senate is not a killing field for his agenda.; But I think there's a deep part of Donald Trump that wants to see these two Republican senators go down as a way to show that, without me on the ticket, you guys can't win, you're not worth diddly.; And I'm not sure that Donald Trump is interested in seeing the two states -- two senators in Georgia win. There may be a part of his motivation to prove a point here on his way out.; To Yvette's point, and I think -- look, I think there's a strategy that the Biden administration is -- or the incoming administration is focusing. They know that there's a constraint -- and Joe Biden's been in -- and Kamala Harris, between them, have about 45 years of work in the U.S. senate, not counting even the staff there.; They know there's limitations and boundaries on what you can get done when it's so divided. So, therefore, the Cabinet is making some overtures, very clearly, to the progressive wing of the party, knowing that very well, on the policy front, it's going to be constrained by what you can do because of the Senate and divided.; And one of the things that they're going to have to focus on -- and I think this is interesting -- is, in this election, you saw Republican states vote for progressive things, like Florida did for the minimum wage, Missouri did for expanding Medicaid.; Those are indications that, if you do a rifle shot approach, don't overshoot what you can get, rifle shot approach, you can get a progressive agenda, and Republican states and Republican voters can support it, if it's not overly ambitious, but targeted and specific.; STEPHANOPOULOS: Sara Fagen, Rahm pointed out that Mitch McConnell and President Trump may not have the same interests.; They clearly have different interests when it comes to the last election, the -- Senator McConnell doing everything he can to prevent Republicans from objecting to the seating -- to the -- accepting the vote in the Electoral College. It's clear whether or not he’s going to succeed.; And it’s pretty clear that the president is continuing to keep on his campaign, with reports of screaming matches in the Oval Office over the weekend.; FAGEN: Yeah. I mean, look, I think this is very --; (LAUGHTER); FAGEN: -- I think -- I think it's troubling. The reality is, you know, the Electoral College has met. The top Republican now in government has spoken. The Republican Party needs to accept that Joe Biden has won this election and needs to move forward.; That's not to say the president doesn't have a voice in the party. He's obviously going to continue and may, in fact, run again in 2024.; But in some respects, you know, Mitch McConnell is in a stronger position today because -- because of what you pointed out earlier, which is even if Republicans take the Senate, it's closely divided, and he's going to become really, an even bigger powerbroker than he was before. Nothing will get done without Mitch McConnell's stamp on it.; And so, for the ultimate deal maker who has a good relationship with the president-elect, I think that we can see some progress in this country which we had not really going back over a decade, even before Trump. There was the division produced post the Affordable Care Act, not a lot.; STEPHANOPOULOS: Any progress is defined by what Sara Fagen was just saying, Yvette, it is destined to disappoint progressives.; SIMPSON: Absolutely. I mean, I think one thing we can do is like take a lesson both from progressive growth in the House and the Trump kind of followers, right?; When you serve people, which is what we did I think early on, that was the expectation at least in the Barack Obama administration. That would -- that's what he was talking about is serving people, whether in rural America, urban America, you serve people first, particular at this time, I think that's going to be unifying. I think you're going to be able to bring the country together.; I think the question is, are you not going to serve people? And I think that would be a failed strategy, particularly because we know that 2022 is around the corner.; Democrats continue, once we get into power, we say, we got to pace it out. We got to slow it down. And then Republicans get the chamber back in the Senate if we get it this time and we can't do anything.; And that means --; (CROSSTALK); STEPHANOPOULOS: Isn't that just reality?; SIMPSON: -- enthusiasm, which means now we can't win.; STEPHANOPOULOS: But isn't that just reality if you're dealing with a 50/50 Senate or a 51/49 Senate?; SIMPSON: Well, I mean, it depends on how you characterize it.; I don't understand why Republicans have characterized their mission to not take care of people, when the reason why so many Americans will say on the fringes, rallied around Donald Trump, it was because he made this promise to serve them. Ultimately, he did not.; But the reality is that it’s not Democrats’ job only to serve people. And it’s not Republicans’ job only to serve special interest. It's supposed to be both of them. How they get there, let's fight about that.; But the idea that the 99 percent of Americans who are suffering under the weight of policies that has benefited the 1 percent, a pandemic that has not adequately served people has suffered on the Republican side and has suffered on Democrats I think.; STEPHANOPOULOS: Chris Christie --; SIMPSON: And I think, hopefully, we can rally around that going forward.; STEPHANOPOULOS: Chris Christie, how do Republicans define themselves in the post-Trump era? It’s pretty clear that the president -- we don't know exactly what he’s going to do, whether he’s actually going to announce that he's running in 2024 or not. We do know he's taken about $60 million in campaign money since the election that he can take -- take with him.; How do Republicans deal with that, with the overhang of President Trump?; CHRISTIE: Well, George, listen, I think what we need to deal with are the issues and facts on the ground that people really care about. And I will tell you, what I heard most people in my neighborhood talking about this week is the vaccinations beginning.; Now, that's an extraordinary accomplishment first and foremost by our scientific community, to have done what they did, and it's an extraordinary accomplishment for the president and his administration. We should be talking about Republican competence, Republican ability to get things done when dealing with COVID going forward.; I will tell you, George, one of the biggest fails you're going to hear about in the next week happened right here in my home state. It's extraordinary. The Department of Health in my home state missed the federal deadline by a day in submitting their paperwork to get our elderly in nursing homes and assisted living facilities vaccinated.; So, instead of starting tomorrow with our elderly and 7,100 of them have died in my state, as they have all across the country, we're going to have to wait another week in New Jersey until the 28th of December for our elderly to get vaccinated.; What the Republicans should be focusing on is saying, we now have this ability to fight the COVID virus. Let's now get after it and make sure we do it exactly right and get life back to normal with our economy and our health of our citizens as quickly as possible.; We focus on that kind of message, the American people are going to be drawn to us.; STEPHANOPOULOS: And, Rahm, it's a reminder that no matter whatever else Joe Biden wants to achieve as president, COVID is going to dominate the agenda, at least until the summer.; EMANUEL: Oh, there's -- COVID and its impact both on health, the economy. But I would actually go back to also with -- Senator Warner was talking about in your earlier part of the show.; George, this attack, or this espionage, whichever -- and the words are important which you mean -- is a new threat that we are just going to begin to unravel. I will say, you know, usually you use the metaphor, you know, you're the dog that caught the car. This may be a situation where the dog aught the truck. Everything you turn around on 360 degrees, Donald Trump has left America worse off than the day he walked in. There is not a single place on the economy, unity, health care, our standing in the world, our vulnerability. Across the board, Joe Biden has to hit the ground -- and that's why I think the team that is assembled has to be put under the banner ready on day one. That is what's his message to the --; FAGEN: But I don't think that's fair.; EMANUEL: I know you -- I didn't think you would --; FAGEN: I don't think --; EMANUEL: Sara, I didn't think you -- I didn't say it because I thought you thought it was fair.; FAGEN: But -- yes, but --; EMANUEL: I just happen to be really down to ground. You tell me where America is better than where it was when he walked in on the 17th of January -- January 2017.; FAGEN: Rahm-- Rahm, you know, a disease -- a disease hit our shows -- no, no, I -- let's --; EMANUEL: We're -- as I --; CHRISTIE: Go get him, Sara.; EMANUEL: Our standing in the world. (INAUDIBLE) --; FAGEN: So, a disease hit our shores and within a year there is a vaccine. The first half of this program was about vaccine production and being shipped.; EMANUEL: That -- that has nothing to do with Donald Trump.; FAGEN: And it does absolutely have every -- a lot to do with Donald Trump. It's not just Donald Trump. It is his government who deserves credit.; EMANUEL: The medical community.; FAGEN: And I think -- I -- of course the medical community, of course the scientists. Nobody's disputing that.; But I will say this about Donald Trump and -- and he deserves much criticism for the way he's handled himself after this election. However, there's something about what he doesn't know that has been a benefit to this country. And he is a bull in a China shop when it comes to getting things done. And he sometimes makes big mistakes. But on this, his pressure on the FDA, his demand of his government to move faster and to break down barriers was a benefit to the country.; EMANUEL: Sara --; FAGEN: And we should give him credit for that. It's fair to criticism him for having cookie meetings in the Oval Office with Sydney Powell, but he should deserve this credit as well.; EMANUEL: Every president, Sara, gets -- every president gets a -- OK, one thing. Every president gets evaluated from what was the status of the country they in -- walked in on and when they leave. And if you think it's better off, great. I -- welcome to that reality. I do not believe that you need history to judge that this president was a loser and a failure and he left America worst off.; FAGEN: I --; CHRISTIE: Yes.; STEPHANOPOULOS: That's going to have to be the last --; FAGEN: I think these are always complex problems and --; EMANUEL: Of course they are. But you can make judgements.; FAGEN: And he's -- and the balance sheet, he has -- he has -- he has positives and negatives.; EMANUEL: Well, the negatives out weight the positives.; CHRISTIE: His passionate evaluation from Rahm. Merry Christmas.; EMANUEL: No, Happy Hanukkah, Chris; STEPHANOPOULOS: I want to wish all of you -- I want to wish all of you a Merry Christmas.; That is all for us today. Thanks for sharing part of your Sunday with us. Stay safe this holiday week and we're wishing you a blessed Christmas.","abcnews.go.com","December 20, 2020, 2:59 PM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-12-20-20-adm-brett-giroir/story?id=74828930"

Brett Giroir","The U.S. reported 249,709 new cases of COVID-19 Friday, a record number.","Adia Robinson","https://abcnews.go.com/author/adia_robinson","Assistant Secretary for Health Adm. Brett Giroir said he would encourage President Donald Trump to receive the COVID-19 vaccine on ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday.; ""I think leadership like the vice president, the surgeon general ... should get vaccines because they will inspire confidence -- with the people who believe in them and trust them,"" Giroir told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos.; ""And again, we have every reason to believe that this vaccine, these two vaccines, are very effective and they are safe,"" he added. ""So, you know, I would encourage the president to get a vaccine for his own health and safety and also to generate more confidence among the people who follow him so closely.""; Vice President Mike Pence was vaccinated publicly on Friday, while Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also received the vaccine, sharing photos on their social media accounts. The White House physician said protecting the vice president's health was a way of ensuring continuity of government, an official in Pence's office told ABC News.; Trump is open to taking the vaccine, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said at a press briefing Tuesday, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people who receive the monoclonal antibody cocktail treatment, which the president did in October, wait 90 days before getting vaccinated. The president also wanted to prioritize front-line workers and those in long-term care facilities, McEnany said.; President-elect Joe Biden and Dr. Jill Biden are expected to be vaccinated Monday.; One Friday, the Food and Drug Administration authorized a second vaccine from Moderna, and distribution of the vaccine began Sunday morning.; Despite the availability of two vaccines, Stephanopoulos pressed Giroir on allegations that vaccine doses were cut which Giroir responded to by saying that states are now ""squared away.""; ""There were some initial projections in November, that was even before we had any vaccine authorized much less two authorized,"" he said. ""The specific projections for this week were given on Tuesday of last week. And those are on track.""; Giroir added that a third vaccine produced by Janssen, the pharmaceutical company owned by Johnson & Johnson, is expected to be submitted for authorization in January.; ""We are very confident that, by June, anyone in America who wants to have a vaccine will have that opportunity to have a vaccine,"" he said.; Stephanopoulos also asked Giroir about recent reports of allergic reactions. As of Friday night, six people have had allergic reactions to the vaccine, the CDC said Saturday according to the Associated Press, including one person who has a history of vaccination reactions.; Giroir said adverse effects are immediately reported to the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC investigates them.; ""We're going to watch these absolutely carefully,"" he said. ""They're immediately reported. And if there's any change in the ... recommendations, they will come out. The CDC updated their recommendations last night, just to be sure that, if you have an allergic reaction to any vaccine, you probably shouldn't take this one.""; ""It's widely recommended for everyone because we know it's 95% effective, as much as 100% effective at preventing severe disease,"" he added. ""And this is the way we end the pandemic, by getting 70% or 80% of the American people vaccinated.""; The pandemic continues to surge nationwide heading into the holiday week. The U.S. reported, 249,709 new cases of COVID-19 as of Friday, a record number, according to data from John Hopkins University. As of Saturday evening, there are more than 113,000 people hospitalized with COVID-19, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project.; Giroir said Sunday that although the end of the pandemic is in sight, Americans still have a lot of work to do.; ""The lives of tens of thousands of Americans depend on what we do. And you know what to do, George,"" he said to Stephanopoulos. ""It's wearing a mask when you're in public, physically distancing, washing your hands. If you're having holiday gatherings, please do them safely. Try to limit them to your immediate household.""; ""We can flatten the curve and save literally tens of thousands of lives if we do these things before we get the vaccine out,"" he added.

"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-wage-confirmation-battle-attorney-general-current-doj/story?id=74817763","Will Biden wage a confirmation battle over attorney general? Some current DOJ insiders hope so","The president-elect could make a final decision in the coming days.","Mike Levine","https://abcnews.go.com/author/mike_levine","As Joe Biden nears a much-anticipated decision over his choice for attorney general, several current officials inside the Justice Department have told ABC News they want the president-elect to launch a contentious confirmation battle against Republican lawmakers if that's what it will take to put the right person in place.; ""That's not a fight that Joe Biden should shy away from,"" one current Justice Department prosecutor told ABC News, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he's not authorized to speak with the press. ""This is the most important pick that Joe Biden's going to make, and the risks of getting this pick wrong are enormous.""; For the prosecutor, that means he hopes Biden nominates former deputy attorney general Sally Yates, who spent more than two decades at the Justice Department but would likely face significant opposition from Republicans during the confirmation process.; ""She's worth fighting for,"" another career federal prosecutor insisted, saying Yates is ""a popular favorite"" within the Justice Department due to her time as U.S. attorney in Atlanta and then as deputy attorney general in the Obama administration. ""I would love for the Biden folks to put up a fight.""; He said two other candidates Biden is reportedly considering for attorney general -- federal judge Merrick Garland and outgoing Alabama senator Doug Jones -- would ""have a learning curve that she doesn't have"" since their time within the department was so long ago.; Other career officials inside the department agreed, with one describing Yates as someone who ""could hit the ground running on day one."" But even some of those who aren't pulling for Yates said they believe Biden should be up for a political fight over his nominee.; ""If there was one cabinet position worth having a confirmation battle over, it's this one,"" said another career Justice Department official, who wants Biden to choose a ""dark horse candidate"" like Preet Bharara, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York who would be the first Indian American attorney general in U.S. history.; Another Bharara supporter inside the Justice Department similarly said attorney general is ""such an important position that it's worth fighting"" for.; For Yates or any nominee to actually become the attorney general, they must receive approval from a majority of the Senate, which is currently controlled by Republicans. That means the Biden team must persuade at least some Republican lawmakers to vote for confirmation -- an inevitably arduous process made even more challenging by the heated political environment. A spokesman for Biden's transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.; As Biden weighs who should take charge of the Justice Department's more than 100,000 employees, many former department officials, advocacy groups and lawmakers have publicly expressed individual preferences. But it's relatively rare for current career officials -- whose positions are inherently apolitical and can span several administrations -- to weigh in publicly.; Yet another federal prosecutor said that while he hopes Biden will pick Yates, he also ""understands the concern"" that the Biden team might have over the resistance she likely would face from Republican lawmakers.; President Donald Trump's allies on Capitol Hill are particularly upset about the last year of her tenure at the Justice Department, when she helped oversee the start of the federal investigation into alleged ties between Trump's campaign and Russian operatives, and when, as acting attorney general in the first days of the Trump administration, she publicly protested Trump's executive order blocking travel from Muslim-majority countries.; Asked recently about Yates as attorney general, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said, ""I don't think so."" But he did say he could give a ""thumbs-up"" to Garland or Jones.; Similarly, according to the Hill, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Yates' actions were ""very worrisome"" and there are ""plenty of people"" available so that Biden ""wouldn't have to take a chance on her.""; Trump himself has publicly attacked Yates, tweeting in August that she ""has zero credibility"" and ""was part of the greatest political crime of the Century.""; Many of the career federal prosecutors who spoke with ABC News balked at the notion that such comments should influence Biden.; ""I've heard a few people around my office comment, 'Who's making this appointment? Is it Joe Biden or [Senate Republican leader] Mitch McConnell?'"" one career federal prosecutor said.; Though Garland and Jones are relatively unfamiliar to many current Justice Department employees, the current officials who spoke to ABC News, including those supporting Yates, acknowledged that Garland and Jones have what one official called ""tremendous reputations.""; Garland has served on the federal appeals court in Washington for more than two decades. President Barack Obama nominated him to the Supreme Court in 2016, but Republicans blocked the nomination.; During the Clinton administration's first term, Garland was appointed to serve as a senior Justice Department official, and he helped oversee the prosecution of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. Before that, he served for nearly three years as an assistant U.S. attorney in Washington.; Jones, also during the Clinton administration, served as U.S. attorney in Alabama, where he led the prosecution of two Ku Klux Klan members for their role in the deadly bombing of Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2017, filling a void created when Jeff Sessions became attorney general.; But one career federal prosecutor predicted that even if Garland or Jones seems ""like a safe, uncontroversial pick,"" there's concern ""ultimately Republicans will make an issue of whoever.""; Almost all of the current officials who spoke with ABC News said they felt any of Biden's choices would be an improvement over recent Justice Department leadership, insisting that the department's reputation has been battered by years of attacks on the department from the president himself and from several politically charged, high-profile decisions by Trump's attorneys general.; The current officials said their new boss -- whomever it is -- needs to reestablish the Justice Department as an independent and credible institution. So, one of the career prosecutors said, although starting that process ""with vitriolic, heated hearings would be frustrating, I think it is a position worth picking a fight for ... if you really feel like you have someone who will inspire people in the Justice Department to do great work and make them feel like they're on the right side of justice again.""; The next attorney general, however, will have to navigate a federal investigation into the global business affairs of Biden's son, Hunter, and a recently appointed special counsel investigating the origins of the Russia probe, which Yates helped oversee at its beginning.; Many of the officials who spoke with ABC News also cited their desire to see the department refocus on matters of civil rights and social justice, and to include women and people of color in leadership positions.; ""Trump appointees,"" a Yates-supporting prosecutor told ABC News, ""have been overwhelmingly white, male.""; That's one of the reasons the career official supporting Bharara hopes Biden chooses him.; ""Make Republicans vote against a historic pick,"" the official said.; ABC News' Alex Mallin and Luke Barr contributed to this report.","abcnews.go.com","December 20, 2020, 12:00 PM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-wage-confirmation-battle-attorney-general-current-doj/story?id=74817763"

Gen. Michael Flynn, who has been publicly prodding Trump to take unprecedented steps to seize a second term -- including declaring martial law and ordering the military to oversee new elections in the battleground states that Trump lost.; ""[Trump] could take military capabilities and he could place them in those states and basically rerun an election in each of those states,"" Flynn said earlier this week on the conservative news outlet Newsmax.; Critics expressed alarm at Friday's meeting, which was first reported by The New York Times. Noah Bookbinder, who heads the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told ABC News that the ideas raised in the Oval Office discussions would represent an ""abuse of power"" and were ""wrong and must be condemned.""; ""President Trump's continued attempts to overturn the results of the election have done immeasurable damage to the stability of our democracy and to the American people's faith in it,"" Bookbinder said. ""The president welcoming Michael Flynn to the White House right after Flynn suggested Trump impose martial law to overturn the election by force takes the threat to a new level.""; Critics contend that Powell's return could usher in a dark final chapter to the Trump presidency, and the prospect has prompted pointed objections from several of Trump's most trusted advisers -- including his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, who has otherwise endorsed a scorched-earth effort to contest the elections.; And Powell's re-emergence in Trump's corner comes at a precarious time for her own career, as many of the targets of her drive to overturn the election have begun to push back. Last week, Dominion Voting Systems, the Colorado voting machine company that fringe pro-Trump forces have targeted with dark conspiracy theories of a rigged election, threatened Powell with legal action if she didn't retract what it called the ""wild, knowingly baseless, and false"" allegations she has made against them.; Nevertheless, Trump invited Powell to consider the possibility that she be appointed a special counsel and be given high-level security clearances to investigate the 2020 election. The meeting was highly contentious, sources told ABC News, filled with screaming and demands from Powell, who called other Trump aids ""quitters"" for giving up the fight.; The meeting ended with White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and other Trump attorneys talking the president out of making the offer, the sources said. Giuliani, who joined the meeting by phone, also opposed the idea, according to sources.; Powell did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.; Powell's allure to Trump appears to be her willingness to explore debunked, stem-winding conspiracy theories suggesting that foreign actors plotted with an American deep state to rig election machines for former Vice President Joe Biden. During Friday's meeting, a source said, the assembled group pondered an executive order to seize and examine voting machines across the country.; That idea had initially been raised by Giuliani earlier in the week, but was quickly shot down by Cipollone and Meadows. When Powell raised it Friday night, the two dismissed it again.; ""I don't even know how that would work,"" U.S. Election Assistance Commission (EAC) Commissioner Ben Hovland told ABC News. ""The voting machines are owned by the local jurisdictions in most cases; those are state and local property, so I don't even know how that makes sense.""; Over the past year, Powell has built a reputation for reaching beyond what other attorneys would consider. She took on Flynn's defense after the former national security adviser had pleaded guilty to lying to federal agents and been upbraided in court by a federal judge. Powell forged a new strategy: recant his plea and place the blame for his legal troubles on his prior defense lawyer and the FBI. The tactics were roundly criticized, but ended with the Justice Department withdrawing charges and Trump issuing Flynn a full pardon.; Powell has also been among the most vocal of Trump's advisers to promote the idea that his 2020 election defeat by more than 7 million votes was actually a mirage, the result of an array of forces had plotted the steal the election from him. A series of scathing court rulings rejected those claims, as did experts on voting technology.; As of Saturday, Dominion Voting Machines had not heard back from Powell or her legal team regarding their demand that she retract her accusations against the company, a Dominion spokesperson confirmed ABC News.; ""The request to retract presents Ms. Powell with a simple choice. Retract her false and defamatory claims about the company and its voting systems, or continue to leave herself open to additional legal action,"" the Dominion spokesperson told ABC News earlier week. ""This would mean going to court to settle the matter.""; ABC News' Ali Dukakis contributed to this report.","abcnews.go.com","December 20, 2020, 1:58 AM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fired-attorney-sidney-powell-back-advising-trump-chart/story?id=74823842"

This story will be updated as more announcements are made.; Here's a look at Biden's picks for the top posts in his administration:; Environmental Protection Agency; Biden announced Michael Regan as his nominee to head the EPA on Dec. 19.; Regan is no stranger to the agency, having previously served nearly a decade there under both Democratic and Republican presidents. He would be the first African American man to run the EPA if confirmed.; Regan is currently secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality.; Department of the Interior; Biden nominated New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland to lead the Department of the Interior.; If confirmed, she would be the first Native American Cabinet secretary.; At an event on Dec. 19 announcing his latest nominees, Biden noted the significance of having Haaland fill ""a critical role.""; ""As the first Native American Cabinet secretary in the history of the United States of America, she'll be a true steward of our national parks, our natural resources and all of our lands,"" he said. ""The federal government has long broken promises to Native American tribes who have been on this land since time immemorial. With her appointment, Congresswoman Haaland will help me strengthen the nation-to-nation relationship.""; Department of Transportation; The president-elect announced on Dec. 15 he would nominate Pete Buttigieg to steer the Department of Transportation.; At 38, Buttigieg is the youngest of Biden’s Cabinet picks so far. He is also poised to become the first openly gay person confirmed by the Senate to a Cabinet post.; Buttigieg is the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He ran against Biden in the Democratic primary and is seen as a rising star in the party.; As transportation secretary, Buttigieg would likely play a key part in implementing Biden’s ambitious infrastructure plan, which aims to offset the impacts of climate change.; Department of Energy; Biden named former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm as his selection to head the Department of Energy on Dec. 17.; Granholm led the Wolverine State during the Great Recession, working with the Obama administration to rescue the U.S. auto industry while promoting investments in green energy.; Granholm has been a strong advocate of zero-emissions vehicles, and her selection is seen as an indication that Biden wants the department to play a principal role in fighting climate change.; If confirmed by the Senate, Granholm -- an immigrant from Canada -- would be just the second woman to serve as secretary of energy.; Department of Defense; Biden announced on Dec. 8 he will nominate retired four-star Army Gen. Lloyd Austin to lead the Department of Defense.; Austin previously headed the military's Central Command, where he was in charge of all American troops in the Middle East. He retired from the military in 2016, after over four decades of service. Because he is less than seven years removed from active duty, he will require a waiver from Congress to hold the position.; If Austin is confirmed, he will become the first Black defense secretary in American history.; Department of Agriculture; Biden, on Dec. 10, announced he will nominate former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack to serve as his secretary of agriculture.; Vilsack led the department for eight years during the Obama administration after he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate in 2009. Prior to that, he served two terms as governor of the Hawkeye State, and he is currently chief executive of the U.S. Dairy Export Council.; Vilsack would be the second member of the Obama administration to reprise their role in Biden's White House, joining the president-elect's nominee for surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, in returning to their former posts if they are both confirmed by the Senate.; Department of Housing and Urban Development; Biden announced on Dec. 10 he will nominate Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge to serve as his secretary of housing and urban development.; Fudge is a member of the House Agriculture Committee and Committee on Education and Labor. She is a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and was recently elected to a seventh term in Congress, representing the Cleveland area.; Amid the recession brought on by the pandemic, millions of Americans are struggling to pay rent, and federal eviction protections set to expire at the end of 2020. If confirmed by the Senate, Fudge may be forced to grapple with a housing crisis as she takes office.; Department of Veterans Affairs; Denis McDonough, who served as former President Barack Obama's chief of staff in his second term, will be nominated, Biden said on Dec. 10, to serve as his secretary of veterans affairs.; McDonough was previously Obama's principal deputy national security adviser, including during the 2011 Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Prior to his eight-year White House tenure, McDonough served in senior leadership and policy-making positions in both chambers of Congress.; He's credited with helping Obama bridge divides on Capitol Hill, including gaining support for the Veterans Choice Act which President Donald Trump later signed into law.; Department of Health and Human Services; On Dec. 6, the president-elect announced he tapped California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to steer the Department of Health and Human Services, a critical role overseeing the implementation of the Biden administration's coronavirus response.; As California's top prosecutor, Becerra took on the Trump administration in more than 100 lawsuits on key issues like health care, immigration, gun control and environmental policies. Before becoming the state's attorney general, he served 12 terms in Congress, representing Los Angeles.; Becerra does not have a background in medicine or public health, but he has established himself as advocate for the Affordable Care Act and women's health care.; Becerra, the son of Mexican immigrants, would be the first Latino to lead the department, if confirmed.; Department of Homeland Security; As part of a rollout of major foreign policy and national security appointments and nominees, the president-elect announced he would nominate Alejandro Mayorkas for secretary of homeland security on Nov. 23.; Mayorkas was born in Havana and came to the United States as a refugee. If the Senate votes to confirm him to the position, he would be the first Latino and the first immigrant to lead the agency in charge of implementing the nation's immigration policies and border laws.; Mayorkas is a veteran of the department; he directed its legal immigration agency and previously served as the deputy secretary of homeland security. He is also one of the architects behind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA).; Department of State; On Nov. 23, Biden tapped Antony Blinken as his choice for secretary of state.; Blinken has advised the president-elect on foreign policy for almost two decades. Previously, he served as deputy national security adviser and deputy secretary of state during the Obama administration.; As the country's top diplomat, Blinken would be expected to play a pivotal part in the Biden administration's efforts to rebuild alliances and reenter international agreements like the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris Climate Accord, as well as halt the country's exit from the World Health Organization.; Department of Treasury; On. Nov. 30, Biden named former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as his selection for treasury secretary. Yellen would be the first woman to serve in the role.; Yellen is currently an economist at the Brookings Institution. She was the first woman to helm the Fed, taking the reins in 2014 as the country recovered from the Great Recession.; A labor expert, Yellen is expected to garner support from progressives. A handful of Senate Republicans who are still in the chamber voted to confirm Yellen to her previous post at the central bank.; If confirmed as treasury secretary, Yellen would enter the post during one of the most trying economic times in modern history, with millions of Americans out of work due to the coronavirus pandemic and lagging job growth.; Director of the Office of Management and Budget; As part of a rollout of his incoming economic leaders, Biden announced on Nov. 30 he would nominate Neera Tanden to serve as director of the Office of Management and Budget.; A former aide to Hillary Clinton, Tanden currently serves as president and CEO of the left-leaning Center for American Progress. She faces an uphill confirmation battle as some Senate Republicans have already indicated her nomination won't pass the chamber's GOP majority, citing her past criticisms of Republican senators whose votes she would need.; If confirmed, Tanden would be the first woman of color and first South Asian American to lead the OMB.; Director of National Intelligence; Biden announced on Nov. 23 that he would nominate Avril Haines as his director of national intelligence.; Haines is a former deputy director of the CIA, and served as principal deputy national security adviser under former President Barack Obama. She was the first woman to hold both of those roles.; If confirmed, she will become the first woman to lead the country's intelligence community.; National Security Adviser; Biden said he would appoint Jack Sullivan as his national security adviser on Nov. 23.; Sullivan previously served as deputy assistant to Obama and as national security adviser to Biden when he was vice president. He's also a former top aide to Hillary Clinton.; At 43, Sullivan would be the youngest person to hold the position since the Eisenhower administration.; This role does not require Senate confirmation.; Special Presidential Envoy for Climate; Biden said he would name former Secretary of State John Kerry as his special presidential envoy for climate on Nov. 23. The newly created role marks the first time the National Security Council will include an official dedicated to climate change.; The Biden transition team did not immediately provide details on what responsibilities the position would entail, but Kerry comes with an extensive resume.; As secretary of state, Kerry negotiated the Paris Climate Accord that was signed in 2016. A longtime Massachusetts senator, Kerry also advocated for climate reform on Capitol Hill. In 2004, he was the Democratic presidential nominee.; This position does not require Senate confirmation.; US Ambassador to the United Nations; Biden announced he would nominate Linda Thomas-Greenfield for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations on Nov. 23.; Thomas-Greenfield was assistant secretary of state for Africa during the Obama administration. She has served in the Foreign Service for more than three decades.; If confirmed, she would be only the second black woman to ever hold the post.; Vice President; Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will be sworn into office on Jan. 20, 2021.; Before she was elected to represent California in the U.S. Senate, she served as the state's attorney general. She ran against Biden in the 2020 Democratic primary race.; She's the first Black woman and first South Asian American to be elected to the second highest office in the land.; White House Chief of Staff; Biden announced he had tapped longtime adviser Ron Klain as his White House chief of staff on Nov. 11.; Klain served as Biden's chief of staff during his vice presidency. He also led the Obama administration's response to the Ebola outbreak.; This post does not require Senate confirmation.","abcnews.go.com","December 20, 2020, 12:23 AM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/president-elect-joe-bidens-top-level-appointees-cabinet/story?id=74362384"

Deb Haaland, D-N.M.; If the Senate confirms her as secretary of the interior, Haaland would be the first Native American to serve in a presidential Cabinet and would be the first Native person to oversee an agency that's played a major role historically in the forced relocation and oppression of Indigenous people.; ""This moment is profound when we consider the fact that a former secretary of the interior once proclaimed his goal to, quote, 'civilize or exterminate' us,"" Haaland said, referring to an 1851 remark made by Alexander H. H. Stuart. ""I'm a living testament to the failure of that horrific ideology. I also stand on the shoulders of my ancestors and all the people who have sacrificed so that I can be here.""; At an event announcing his latest nominees in Wilmington, Delaware, on Saturday, Biden noted the significance of having Haaland fill ""a critical role.""; ""As the first Native American Cabinet secretary in the history of the United States of America, she'll be a true steward of our national parks, our natural resources and all of our lands. The federal government has long broken promises to Native American tribes who have been on this land since time immemorial. With her appointment, Congresswoman Haaland will help me strengthen the nation-to-nation relationship,"" Biden said.; Haaland spoke about her upbringing as a member of the Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico, saying her experiences have made her ""fierce.""; ""My life has not been easy,"" she said. ""I struggled with homelessness. I relied on food stamps and raised my child as a single mom. These struggles give me perspectives, though, so that I can help people to succeed. My grandparents, who were taken away from their families as children and sent to boarding school, in an effort to destroy their traditions and identities, maintained our culture.""; Those experiences could help Haaland succeed in her new role, especially in addressing the climate crisis and the disproportionate impact of pollution on minority communities.; ""As our country faces the impacts of climate change and environmental injustice, the Interior Department has a role to address these challenges. The president-elect's goals, driven by justice and empowering communities who have shouldered the burdens of environmental negligence, we will ensure that the decisions at Interior will once again be driven by science,"" Haaland said.; Joining Haaland at the announcement were other Biden climate nominees, tasked with carrying out his ambitious policy that would seek to move the country toward a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035, including Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, Biden's Energy Department secretary-designate, and North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality Director Michael Regan, nominated to lead the Environmental Protection Agency -- the first Black man so nominated.; Also at the event was former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy, tapped to be Biden's national climate adviser, a new position in the Biden Administration.; The picks join Biden's historically diverse cabinet, following through on his promise to build an administration that ""looks like America."" To date, Biden has named more women and persons of color to his cabinet than has any previous administration.; Haaland is also joined by another barrier-breaking Cabinet pick, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who was nominated as secretary of transportation and would be the first openly gay cabinet secretary to be confirmed.","abcnews.go.com","December 19, 2020, 11:28 PM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/haaland-makes-history-interior-secretary-nominee/story?id=74822889"

Amid the ongoing hack, Pompeo is also closing the last two U.S. consulates in Russia, citing the caps on American personnel that Moscow has forced on the U.S. mission in recent years.; Once welcomed by Trump, those caps, which have hamstrung U.S. diplomats, were Russian retaliation against U.S. sanctions for its aggression online, in neighboring Ukraine, and with chemical weapons.; ""This was a very significant effort, and I think it's the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity,"" Pompeo told conservative radio host Mark Levin late Friday, hours before Trump's tweet.; But Pompeo also indicated that the administration is not planning to take any action against Vladimir Putin's government, at least not publicly: ""There are many things that you'd very much love to say, 'Boy, I'm going to call that out,' but a wiser course of action to protect the American people is to calmly go about your business and defend freedom.""; The SolarWinds hack is a ""significant and ongoing cybersecurity campaign,"" according to the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The intrusion involves software from SolarWinds, which makes IT management tools, that had been ""Trojanized"" with a vulnerability that could be exploited by hackers to steal information, manipulate systems or plant trap doors and other exploits for future use.; Russia has denied responsibility for the hack. So far, the Departments of State, Homeland Security, Commerce, and Energy, as well as the National Institutes of Health all have reportedly been affected.; ""The magnitude of this ongoing attack is hard to overstate,"" Trump's former homeland security adviser Thomas Bossert wrote this week. ""If it is Russia, President Trump must make it clear to Vladimir Putin that these actions are unacceptable. The U.S. military and intelligence community must be placed on increased alert; all elements of national power must be placed on the table.""; After days of silence, Trump claimed on Saturday that the media is exaggerating the security breach's impact. He said he has ""been fully briefed and everything is well under control.""; He went on to tweet that China may be behind the attack instead of Russia and claimed that there ""could also have been a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election.""; While no public response seems to be coming soon, the U.S. is being forced to take another step that will cut into relations with Russia -- closing its last two consulates in the country.; A State Department spokesperson confirmed to ABC News Friday that Pompeo, in consultation with U.S. ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, decided to permanently close the U.S. consulate in Vladivostok and temporarily close the one in Yekaterinburg.; This leaves just the U.S. embassy in Moscow as the only U.S. mission in the country. Russia forced the U.S. to close its consulate in St. Petersburg in 2018 in retaliation for the U.S. shuttering its facility in Seattle because of the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the United Kingdom.; The U.S. facility in Vladivostok, Russia's major Pacific port near the border with North Korea, had been closed since March because of COVID-19 when most of its staff evacuated. The consulate in Yekaterinburg, Russia's fourth-largest city, was the only U.S. mission for the center of Russia.; The spokesperson said in a statement that the decision was ""part of our ongoing efforts to ensure the safe and secure operation of the U.S. diplomatic mission in the Russian Federation"" and ""was taken to optimize the work of the U.S. mission.""; But in a private notice to Congress, sent last week and first obtained by The Associated Press Friday evening, the department said it was a ""response to the ongoing staffing challenges of the U.S. Mission in Russia in the wake of the 2017-imposed personnel cap on the U.S. Mission and resultant impasse with Russia over diplomatic visas.""; Russia imposed caps on the U.S. presence in 2017 in retaliation to sanctions placed by the Obama administration over the 2016 election interference --- a move that has hamstrung U.S. diplomats, but which President Trump said he was ""very thankful"" for though the White House later said he was being ""sarcastic."" That low point in U.S.-Russian relations is rivaled by the current one, with Russia believed to be responsible for the massive SolarWinds hack, which has also affected the private sector. Pompeo is the first U.S. official to go on the record and blame the Russian government, after U.S. officials told ABC News and other outlets that Moscow was likely responsible.; ""We're still unpacking precisely what it is, and I'm sure some of it will remain classified.

Caleb Boggs to represent Delaware in the Senate -- one of the youngest people ever elected to the body. But it was a different headline a month after the election that would forever change his life: ""Biden's wife, child killed in car crash.""; ""I was down in Washington hiring staff and I got a phone call from a first responder. They put a pretty young woman on the phone. She was so nervous, she said, 'You gotta come home. There's been an accident. A tractor trailer hit your wife and your three children while they were shopping,'"" Biden recalled at a campaign event in Newton, Iowa, last August.; ""My wife was killed and my daughter was killed,"" he continued. ""And my two boys, but for the jaws of life, and a rescue crew saving their life, would not have been around either.""; Friday morning, on the 48th anniversary of the accident, the president-elect refrained from public events, instead visiting the graves of his late wife, Neilia, and daughter, Naomi, at Brandywine Roman Catholic Church with his wife, Jill, near his home in Wilmington, Delaware.; The anniversary comes, as it did in 1972, as Biden is preparing for a new role in public life -- this time the presidency. The role caps off a lifetime in politics that almost ended before it began. Biden had initially decided to stay in the Senate for only six months following his wife and daughter's deaths and in order to care for his injured sons.; Despite his initial unwillingness to serve, Biden remained in the Senate and public life, turning his grief into a way to connect with others through empathy -- a trait that has perhaps most defined his career.; ""I think empathy is a critically important thing. It doesn't make it easier to talk about because you've been through it, but when you've been through it and you talk to people about it, they go, ""OK, I know he or she understands, because they've been through it,'"" Biden said Thursday during an interview on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.""; Anecdotes of Biden's acts of empathy have drawn headlines over the years, with many resurfaced during his 2020 campaign. Just under a month before the election, a 2002 apology letter Biden sent to a woman -- after his office continued to send letters to her late husband -- went viral; ""[T]hough I would never presume to know how you feel, I understand something of what it means to lose a spouse suddenly. For me, it went far beyond grief, to a kind of anger and guilt and sense of the world being turned upside down,"" Biden wrote in the letter, apologizing for ""screwing up"" and causing her pain.; ""I often tell people who lose a loved one that the 'firsts' are always the hardest -- the first Christmas, the first birthday, the first anniversary. I know from my experience how little words can mean at such a time, but I know, as hard as it can be to believe, that time does heal,"" he continued.; In 2014, the then-vice president sent a memo to his staff urging them not to prioritize work over family obligations, saying if he found out that staffers were working instead of attending a family event, it would ""disappoint [him] greatly."" He noted prioritizing family time was ""an unwritten rule since [his] days in the Senate.""; ""The way we all rationalize, 'I'd have to take the red eye back home for her birthday, but it really doesn't matter that much to my wife -- her birthday,' or, 'If I just make this business trip, I'll miss his last football game, but he'll understand.' It's just a bunch of malarkey. It's just not true,"" Biden said on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon"" in 2016.; ""I don't want anybody in my staff feeling an obligation to do something for me when there's something that matters in the family,"" he said.; Biden almost did not make a third run for the White House, after suffering another personal tragedy as vice president, when his eldest son, Beau Biden, lost his battle with glioblastoma at the age of 46 in 2015.; The former vice president, who actively considered a run in 2016, ultimately decided against it, retreating from public life to pen his memoir, ""Promise me, Dad,"" about the loss of his son.; ""I wanted to give people hope that there is -- through purpose -- you can find your way through grief. And that's the purpose of the book,"" Biden said.; Biden's promise to his son to stay engaged even after his death led the former vice president to make his third attempt at the presidency against Donald Trump at 77 years old. Now, as Biden is just a month away from taking the oath of office, he is facing a country struggling, as COVID-19 continues to spread.; While speaking with Colbert, future first lady Jill Biden said she believed Biden's long-held empathy was part of his win.; ""I think one of the reasons Joe was elected was because of his sense of empathy. I think people understand that he's had a lot of tragedy and loss in our family and he understands what they're going through,"" she said.; When asked Thursday by Colbert about his view of the presidency amid the ""unaddressed grief"" of the country, Biden returned to a message he has often shared with those looking for comfort after loss.; ""The role of the presidency is to say, 'Grieve. There's a reason to grieve. You've had great loss,"" he said. ""But there will come a time, remind yourself, just be reminded that the time will come when you'll think of your husband, wife, son, daughter, mom or dad, and you'll get a smile to your lips before you get a tear to your eye. That's how you know you're going to make it.'""","abcnews.go.com","December 19, 2020, 11:00 AM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/50-years-death-wife-daughter-empathy-remains-joe/story?id=74814251"

The plea has been part of Trump's massive post-election fundraising effort, much of which has been going to Trump's new political action committee, Save America.; But none of the funds the president has brought into his new PAC appear to have gone to actually help the Republican Senate runoff campaigns, ad placement data and campaign disclosure records show.; ""The Georgia Runoff Election is right around the corner and the fate of the Nation hangs in the balance,"" Trump's team wrote in a fundraising email sent to supporters this week. ""So much is at stake and I need to know that you are on our team and ready to FIGHT for America.""; ""It is CRITICALLY important we have your support to secure the resources we need to deliver the Democrats a CRUSHING defeat,"" they wrote in another recent email.; In the fine print, the letter breaks down the distribution of funds as follows: 25% of each contribution goes to the RNC, and 75% of each contribution first goes to Save America, up to $5,000, with the rest of the 75% going to the Trump campaign, up to $2,800 for an individual donor and $5,000 for a PAC donor.; The RNC so far has spent roughly $3 million in independent expenditures supporting the Georgia GOP candidates, and has committed to spend more than $20 million in the runoffs overall.; ""We currently have the largest team ever in Georgia, which includes 500 paid staffers and thousands of volunteers,"" RNC spokesperson Mike Reed told ABC News. ""Our teams have knocked on millions of doors over the past few weeks.""; Reed added that the RNC's focus is on the ground game and get out the vote efforts as they typically leave the ad buys and other electioneering activities to the campaigns and outside groups.; Indeed, since Election Day in November, hundreds of outside groups on both sides of the aisle have spent, or committed to spend, in support of the Georgia candidates. The television and radio ad spending alone is quickly approaching the $500 million mark, powered by the funds raised by the campaigns and political interest groups.; But Trump's new leadership PAC is not one of them. The PAC has not placed any television or radio buys in the race, according to media research company CMAG's analysis of ad-buy records, and it has not reported making any independent expenditures in support of Republican Sens. David Perdue or Kelly Loeffler, as required by the Federal Election Commission rules.; The full extent of the committee's fundraising and spending has yet to be disclosed, so it's unclear if any of the funds have been used to support Trump's recent political travels to Georgia or if the PAC has made any direct contribution to the campaigns. But even if it has, the maximum contribution a PAC can make is $5,000 -- which would appear to be a small fraction of the money coming in.; Officials with Save America did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.; A super PAC set up by Donald Trump Jr.'s advisers, which doesn't raise money with the Trump committees, did report spending more than $1 million on the races.; Michael Beckel, research director at the campaign transparency advocacy group Issue One, told ABC News that while it's common for candidates in a contentious race to try to leverage the celebrity appeal of higher-profile politicians, it is highly unusual for a sitting president to be using a contentious election as a hook to raise money for their own political operation.; ""It is extremely uncommon for an outgoing president to be so aggressively soliciting contributions for a leadership PAC, let alone using high-profile races as a hook to entice donors to give without investing much of the money raised into said races,"" Beckel told ABC News. ""President Trump's Save America PAC has, to date, raised an extraordinary amount of money, and President Trump faces few restrictions on how to spend the money he raises for his leadership PAC.""; Some Republicans who are actively raising money to support the GOP candidates say Trump's leadership PAC is problematic.; ""I think it's problematic if they're raising money and the implication is you are going to help Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue win, because really that is the most important thing right now,"" Martha Zoller, a former Georgia congressional candidate who now runs Georgia United Victory, a super PAC spending millions in support of the Republicans in the runoffs.; ""The president is going to do what the president is going to do, but my goal is to win these races,"" Zoller said. ""And if he's raising money based on that, then he should be spending the money to help get the vote out.""; ""2022 doesn't matter, 2024 doesn't matter,"" Zoller added, referring to the possibility of Trump seeking reelection in 2024. ""If we don't win on Jan. 5, Republicans are going to have a very different landscape for the next two and four years. I think it's time for the president to think about the country as a whole and not just the folks that voted for him.""; ""Everyone in our ecosystem could be operating in the best way they see fit,” said one GOP strategist, who spoke to ABC News on the condition of anonymity. The strategist added, ""it’s imperative that everyone on the Republican side work together to effectively pull resources and make sure that any dollar that can be spent in Georgia is deployed for Jan. 5.""; While Save America has not yet spent any money on the runoffs, the new super PAC launched by Donald Trump Jr.'s advisers, called Save the US Senate PAC, has reported spending more than $1.2 million on the contests, with more than half a million dollars of that going to television ads and the rest to digital ads and other efforts, ad placement data and FEC disclosure reports show.; But that's a small fraction of what some of the bigger and more committed groups are spending. The Karl Rove-led super PAC American Crossroads has aired and booked nearly $48 million on ads in Georgia, while the super PAC Senate Leadership Fund and its local affiliate, Peachtree PAC, have together spent $87 million on ads so far, ad buy records show.; Overall, GOP outside groups have been vastly outspending Democratic groups on ads, with Republicans scheduled to spend $162 million on television and radio ads through the first week of January, with Democratic groups only spending $46 million.; ""This is an absolutely all hands on deck effort,"" Senate Leadership Fund spokesperson Jack Pandol told ABC News. ""We're taking a leadership role with the amount of money that we're spending, but we welcome all the help we can get. This is an extremely important election that's going to decide a lot about our country's future.""","abcnews.go.com","December 19, 2020, 1:28 AM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-pac-fundraising-off-georgia-runoffs-spending-candidates/story?id=74809718"

Airing Tuesday nights on ABC News Live Prime 7pm ET.; As the novel coronavirus ravages the nation's economy, firearms dealers are reporting a banner year of business as repeat customers are building up home arsenals and first-time buyers seek to enhance their personal security.; ""When COVID initially hit the streets in the United States of America, business really started to take off,"" said Brandon Wexler, owner of Wex Gunworks in Delray Beach, Florida. ""Almost, as far as an analogy, [like] prepping for a hurricane in South Florida.""; An estimated 21 million guns have been sold so far in 2020, up 73% over the same period last year, according to an analysis of FBI background check data by The Trace, an independent investigative news site.; The run on guns reflects what experts call a perfect storm of fear-inducing conditions: the pandemic, economic recession, civil unrest and a divisive presidential election.; ""I've never owned a gun. I've never wanted a gun. I've never had a gun in my home,"" said Florida mother of three Trish Beaudet, who recently purchased her first handgun.; ""It really bothers me when I watched things on the news, when you talk about the riots, and the looting, and the violence that's happening,"" Beaudet said. ""Pulling a gun is the last thing I ever want to do, but I want to know that if I need to protect myself, my family, my, you know, my children, that I can do that.""; Erin Hart, a recently divorced African American mother of two and a self-described Democrat, said social and political polarization in her community have shaken her sense of safety.; ""My nightmare scenario would be being at home alone, middle of the night, and just myself and, you know, the boys, and, and someone coming in to harm us,"" Hart said. ""When things start to hit a little closer home it kind of makes you sit up and think about it.""; The presidential transition also is a huge factor, experts said, as Democratic President-elect Joe Biden has vowed sweeping new restrictions on guns.; ""It is generally true that when we have a president coming from the Democratic Party that we see higher firearms demand, and associated sales are primarily stimulated by the fear that there may be federal legislation pushed through,"" said Jurgen Brauer, chief economist at Small Arms Analytics, a nonpartisan research group.; Robyn Thomas, executive director of the Giffords Law Center, called the dynamic a textbook case of ""panic.""; ""I also believe that the gun industry, and the NRA, and to some extent even the [Trump] administration, are stoking people's fear,"" Thomas said.; Biden, who declared gun manufacturers ""the enemy"" during his 2020 campaign, plans a gun safety crackdown on day one of his administration.; He said he will ask Congress to repeal liability protections for gunmakers and close loopholes for background checks, according to his campaign. He also wants to ban production of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require registration for existing assault weapons, limit individual gun purchases to one per month and end all online sales.; All proposals will require legislative action, which will be a tough sell in a narrowly divided Congress.; ""I don't know what these laws will be passed, but that's got people [thinking] to 'buy my gun now or I'm not going to be able to get it again,'"" said Robert Boyce, a retired NYPD chief of detectives and an ABC News contributor.; Months of racial unrest nationwide have influenced new buyers, with some citing a perception that local law enforcement may respond more timidly to potential crimes.; ""After this whole George Floyd incident, the crime rate in Minneapolis has skyrocketed,"" Minneapolis resident Dawn Le told ABC News in an interview in September. ""And now they're wondering, you know, why the police can't get there quick enough because there is no police, you know? But yet they want to defund the police.""; This month, the Minneapolis City Council cut $8 million from its police budget. Several other major U.S. cities have pulled back spending on police, but most have maintained or increased police budgets for next year, according to an analysis by Bloomberg CityLab.; ""The arrow has gone too far the other way on this. So we have to come back to basics and be smart about this,"" Boyce said.; The perception, however accurate, of police having fewer resources is fueling gun sales, industry experts told ABC News.; ""People, again, are taking a look at what's around them, taking stock of their own security and their safety needs, and they're realizing that their elected officials are abandoning them,"" said Mark Oliva of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry trade group.; As gun sales surge, so have gun deaths.; Through early December, 1,600 more lives have been lost this year than last year, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive. Over the last four years, bullets have killed at least 155,000 Americans.; Four of the nation's 10 deadliest mass shootings have taken place since 2016 -- 59 killed in Las Vegas in October 2017, 26 in Sutherland, Texas, in November 2017, 23 at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, in August 2019, and 17 killed at a Parkland, Florida, high school in February 2018.; ""It shouldn't be that normal -- that culture should not be normalized,"" said Bria Smith, a student leader with March for Our Lives, the movement calling for action on gun violence in the wake of the Parkland shooting.; Hundreds of thousands of young people descended on Washington in 2018 in an extraordinary call for action on guns, and President Donald Trump promised to lead an effort with Congress to respond.; ""We don't want guns in the hands of the wrong people. I think that the Republicans are going to be great and lead the charge, along with the Democrats,"" Trump said in August 2019.; Those promises remain unfulfilled. Trump, like his predecessor, Barack Obama, was unwilling or unable to break the gridlock in Congress, which hasn't passed a major gun safety bill in decades.; ""It's like this weird romanticizing of gun culture in our country,"" said Smith, now a college student in Milwaukee.; ""I mean, we had our president willingly say on a public debate stage to the [Proud Boys to 'stand by and stand back,'"" she said. ""When you look at the bigger picture, it's making sure that you have an administration that cares for you set in place first.""; With sales soaring, many gun safety advocates have said the most urgent need now is ensuring safer use of existing guns and providing better police training.; ""We're starting to really rebrand our mission. Before, it was to eradicate all gun violence across the country, across the globe. But right now, I think it's just taking construction to reimagine,"" Smith said.; Thomas said her hope is that new gun owners will get safety training.; ""That they learn how to properly use and store weapons if they choose to keep them in their home because of those risks,"" Thomas said. ""This is an unprecedented moment in this country.""; At Wex Gunworks, safety training classes are a top priority, which several of the newest graduates say is a smart idea for all Americans.; ""It's extremely important. I don't want to be in a position where I unnecessarily hurt somebody by my negligence,"" said Beaudet.; ""I think that even if you don't own a gun that it is imperative that you take the safety course in handling one,"" added Hart. ""You never know when you could be put in a position or a situation where you would come across one.""; And, despite the divide over Biden's gun proposals in the pro-gun community, Beaudet, Hart and Wexler all agreed that stronger background checks are something everyone should support.; ""As far as the president-elect, you know, these background checks are the most important thing there is,"" Wexler added. ""Everyone gets a background check, and there's no ifs, ands or buts.""","abcnews.go.com","18 December 2020, 23:50","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fear-fuels-gun-sales-biden-vows-crackdown/story?id=74759162"

""Anyone who is telling you differently, whether it's in the media, whether it's the Democrat talking heads or whether it's the Republican establishment, is just avoiding the facts.""; But when it comes to facts, the nation's top attorney disagreed. The Justice Department uncovered no evidence of widespread voter fraud that would tip the results of the presidential election, Attorney General William Barr said.; Voters in Arizona generally split their tickets; voting for Biden and Democrat Sen. Mark Kelly at the top of the ballot, and re-electing Republicans down the ballot. Any claims brought by the party or the president's allies have been thrown out in court, and the party is now pursuing audits through subpoena power enacted by members of the Republican-led state legislature.; Ward won her post in 2019 after two statewide losses in Republican primaries for U.S. Senate seats against late Sen. John McCain and former Sen. Martha McSally.; She's been challenging the election in unsuccessful courtroom battles and criticizing fellow Republican, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, who has defended the state's election integrity in the face of pushback from Ward and President Donald Trump.; Despite Monday's Electoral College votes for Biden, Ward, who is a Trump elector, and other GOP electors in Arizona still met to cast unofficial ballots for the president-- and 27 members of the Arizona state legislature penned a joint resolution calling on Congress to accept those ballots, rather than the ones signed and certified by Secretary of State Katie Hobbs.; James Strickland, an associate professor of political science at Arizona State University, said that Republicans' insistence on challenging election results might be a political strategy for future elections.; ""There seem to be many people within the party who genuinely have questions about election processes, but filing lawsuits also may be an electoral strategy for 2022 and 2024,"" Strickland said about election fraud claims. ""Doing so may allow party officials to claim that they are pursuing all available options, thereby encouraging donors and other supporters to remain involved and, importantly, turn out to vote in those future elections.""; ""Angry voters tend to turn out,"" he added. ""If the party leadership is indeed pursuing the fraud claims to achieve a political benefit, then this would suggest that they believe a sizable enough portion of their supporters will appreciate and reward those efforts.""; The president has used his courtroom battles as a massive post-election fundraising mechanism. The Trump campaign and the GOP raised at least $170 million since Election Day, ABC News reported Dec. 1.; Arizona-based Republican strategist Chuck Coughlin said that the election fraud accusations have created a tough road for members who don't support those claims.; ""They've hung on to this election fraud thing that is a presidential narrative that goes back to the Iowa primaries. When [Trump] lost to Ted Cruz, he said that he's just unwilling to accept any electoral outcome that he doesn't win,"" Coughlin said.; As in other battleground states across the country, challenges to election results in Arizona are propelled by false claims of apparent fraud. Republicans recently counted a win after the state Senate Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Maricopa County in order to conduct a forensic audit of its voting machines and two recent suits thrown out by courts in Arizona have been appealed, one to the U.S. Supreme Court and the other to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.; Overall, Trump and his allies filed nearly 60 lawsuits as part of the effort to overturn the results of the election, nearly all of which have since been dismissed by judges, often with sharply worded rulings. At least six suits were filed in Arizona alone. Last week, the United States Supreme Court rejected a bid led by Texas and supported by Trump to throw out votes from four swing states -- a significant blow to the effort to get the courts to overturn the results of the election. Secretaries of state across the country told ABC News last month that there was no evidence of widespread election fraud, and post-election audits of voting machines returned miniscule differences in the vote count.; Despite the lack of success in the courts, dissension in the ranks continued to bubble over following Ducey's involvement in Arizona's election certification process.; According to Coughlin, these types of battles aren't uncommon in Arizona. He said there's a faction of the party which has ""consistently been anti-establishment, libertarian-leaning Republicans who dominate insider politics.""; ""It's the narrow base of the Republican party that it operates from. And elected officials who don't have a broader base of support are vulnerable to that. McCain back in the day was the only one that could withstand it, and nobody else has that kind of broad base support. Clearly the governor doesn't have that,"" he said.; Ducey has drawn the ire of Trump, who wondered publicly on Twitter what the governor's ""rush"" was to certify the results. The governor became a target of Trump and his allies following Arizona's election certification. All of Arizona's 15 counties, led by Republicans and Democrats, canvassed and certified their own elections, which were then sent to Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and her office for further statewide audits. Only then, weeks after the election on Nov. 30, did Ducey participate in a certification of the statewide results alongside Hobbs and Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich.; While Ducey certified results, a meeting led by Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis continued to sow doubt about the election. It was attended by some state legislators and newly reelected members of Congress, including Reps. Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs, who were all presented with baseless conspiracy theories of election fraud in Arizona.; Coughlin said it is no surprise that the party has turned its criticism on Ducey in light of Trump's loss.; ""There isn't any other narrative than the Trump narrative,"" Coughlin told ABC News. ""If you try and break away from that narrative at all, you see what happens. The first victim of that was Jeff Flake, the second victim was John McCain.""; ""It's you either step in line, and you follow whatever the president says, including overthrowing the legitimate elections, or you're gonna face the ire of everybody else who's still on the train,"" he added.; Strickland said he thinks it is too early to say whether or not the Republican party will be able to work past the Trump era in the coming years.; ""I imagine that Donald Trump will continue to have influence within the Republican Party, and that he might be a kingmaker in 2024, if he chooses not to run for president himself. Going forward, I imagine that the success of local political officials who have associated themselves with the fraud cases will depend on Trump's popularity within the Republican Party,"" Strickland said.; Republicans across the country have campaigned for legislatures in battleground states to convene and grant a new slate of electors to cast ballots for Trump instead of Biden, which is not allowed by the Arizona Constitution.; Ducey has all but denied calls for a special session, saying he would see the legislature on Jan. 11, when its next session is set to begin.; House Speaker Russell Bowers also eventually shut down the idea of convening the legislature, saying he would not authorize a special session and pointing to Arizona's Constitution and the lack of substantial evidence presented by Giuliani and Ellis.; His resistance to bringing the legislature into session, in part, started calls for members of the statehouse not to vote for Bowers for Speaker of the House in the next session.; Coughlin said the public quarrels are the ""burning down of your own house.""; ""They don't care because this is part of the party that puts the party ahead of country,"" he said. ""If you don't believe the Trump message of division, then you're not a Republican. You know, you're a 'RINO' and it's a very narrow place to build a party from. Arguably it's incapable of winning a statewide election in Arizona.""; ABC News' Olivia Rubin contributed reporting.","abcnews.go.com","December 18, 2020, 10:04 PM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/arizona-gop-leaders-quarrel-election-results-impact-partys/story?id=74625518"

The process of selecting the appointments flows through the White House Office of White House Presidential Personnel Office, headed up by Johnny McEntee, who previously served as the president's personal assistant before being escorted off the White House grounds amid issues with his background clearance.; The practice of lame-duck appointments is by no means new or unusual. The president’s two most recent predecessors, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush, made a similar flurry of appointments in the final days of their lame-duck administrations.; “In many ways, [it] is a vestige of the spoil system, where you have political leaders that are able to hand out these plums, not because somebody has deserved it from the perspective of, they're serving their country or having a particular expertise, but because of the political closeness to the president,” said Max Stier, the president of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service that aims to improve government effectiveness.; The White House declined to comment on the uptick in appointments and nominations in the final days of the administration.; But a person familiar with the process characterized the list of appointments as being ""literally a laundry list of all these people who claimed to have been shut out of things for the wrong reasons who are now just being given these things, and there’s even less pressure knowing it doesn’t matter anymore.""; Like Trump, Obama appointed political allies and donors to various boards and commissions in his final months in office.; In November 2016, President Obama named Fred Eychaner, a prominent Democratic donor, to the board of trustees of the Kennedy Center.; On Jan. 5, 2017, he appointed Eric Schwerin, a business partner of Vice President Joe Biden’s son Hunter, to the Commission for the Preservation of America’s Heritage Abroad.; Leon Panetta, who served as chief of staff to President Clinton and as CIA director and defense secretary under President Obama, said the “biggest difference” between Trump’s appointments and those of past presidents “is that a lot of these people that Trump is appointing don't necessarily reflect the kind of background that will help them in their new job.”; Last week, Trump named Michael Anton, a former spokesman for the Trump National Security Council, to the Board of Directors of the National Board for Education Sciences, which advises leaders of the Department of Education’s research division, along with Larry Schweikart, a retired historian and author of “48 Liberal Lies about American History (That You Probably Learned in School).”; Panetta pointed specifically to Trump confidants and campaign operatives David Bossie and Cory Lewandowski, who were appointed in early December to the Pentagon’s Defense Business Board after the White House removed the members serving on the board, which was formed in 2002 to provide senior Pentagon officials with “independent advice on business management issues,” according to its website.; “It just makes clear that the purpose of the appointment was not to enhance our defense establishment and national security, it's to plant people on the inside who are politically supporters of President Trump,” Panetta added.; While both were appointed to four-year terms, a U.S. defense official added that “members serve at the pleasure of the current administration” raising the very real possibility that President-elect Joe Biden will boot them out.; Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union and husband of longtime aide Mercedes Schlapp, has been tapped to sit on the Library of Congress Trust Fund Board.; Marcia Lee Kelly, an adviser to first lady Melania Trump, was awarded a position on the Committee for the Preservation of the White House.; Longtime friend Jared Kushner friend Adam Boehler was tapped as a member of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council.; Another key difference in Trump’s case, however, is that he’s partaking in what is a common practice of a lame-duck presidents in apparent contradiction to his simultaneous crusade to overturn his election defeat, despite having lost both the Electoral College and popular vote.; “At the end of an administration, there is a sense of trying to generate whatever value there is by handing out all plums that are available, you know, with great dispatch, which if you thought you were going to be around you wouldn't need that same sense of urgency,” Stier observed.; ABC News’ Jon Garcia and Luis Martinez contributed to this report.","abcnews.go.com","December 18, 2020, 4:48 PM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-rushes-dole-plum-appointments-allies-door/story?id=74739837"

The hologram technology of HoloLens has been taken many steps further to help soldiers plan and execute their missions.; ""This is a transformational change for the Army,"" Ryan McCarthy, the secretary of the Army, told ABC News.; ""I think absolutely that the future is here,"" said Gen. James McConnville, the Army's chief of staff. ""This is going to fundamentally change the way we do business in the United States military.""; ABC News accompanied McCarthy, McConnville, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella as they recently visited Fort Pickett, Virginia, to see a demonstration of IVAS's capabilities.; Attached to their combat helmets, the clear goggles allow soldiers to know precisely where they are thanks to a heads-up display, known as HUD, that provides them with an overhead compass and overlays maps of their location.; ""Everybody can share in the experience,"" said Kipman. ""You can place different points of interest in the world and then see arrows in front of you that really guide you from point A to point B.""; The Soldiers and Marines testing the goggles at Fort Pickett have been impressed by the amount of information the goggles provide and say that despite all of its complexity it is as easy to use as a smartphone.; ""It combines a lot of things that we currently utilize, such as global positioning devices, or G.P.S., communication devices, as well, as land navigation tools, mission planning tools,"" said Marine Cpl. Ryan Sweckard.; ""Those are things that are commonly individual technologies that are now combined into this one system,"" said Sweckard. ""To combine everything, everybody seeing into one system, that's impressive.""; Troops no longer need paper maps to plan their missions ahead of time, instead they use the holograms and 3D terrain maps projected onto their goggles to see what lies ahead.; ""As a platoon leader, I can see where my entire platoon is projected onto like a holographic map, said Lt. Nicholas Christopher, from the Army's 82nd Airborne Division. ""And for me, that's amazing because there's a lot of guesswork that goes out the window.""; ""There's a lot of verbal communication over radios that I don't have to do anymore,"" he added.; During training the goggles lets troops see holograms of enemy fighters as they move to clear a room, and afterwards troops can gather to watch another hologram that gives them an overhead view oft heir mission.; The goggles also incorporate night vision and thermal imagery technologies that are a significant step up from what soldiers are currently using.; While current night vision goggles provide a limited field of view comparable to looking through a straw, IVAS provides a full 180-degree field of view.; By turning a knob, troops can easily switch to thermal technology that enables them to see through smoke, a capability that night vision goggles cannot provide.; Adding a scope to a rifle gives troops an edge in dangerous urban warfare by letting them peer around corners. What the scope sees ahead is projected onto the HUD no matter what direction a soldier is looking.; ""I can literally just peek my weapon around the corner,"" said Army Staff Sgt. Caleb Kester. ""And whether I'm looking to the right, the left, straight up, straight down, I have that picture in my view.""; ""The new integration of infrared, thermal, and a heads-up display will help increase the survivability of our troops, as well as their lethality to the enemy,"" said Eric Oehlerich, a former Navy SEAL and an ABC News contributor.; Mick Mulroy, a retired Marine, CIA paramilitary officer and ABC News contributor agreed that IVAS will help troops, but urged caution on becoming too reliant on advanced technologies ""as our enemies will surely try and come up with a way to defeat them.""; Because of that Oehlerich said soldiers should maintain their basic military skills because ""it's hard to counter a paper map and magnetic compass.""; McCarthy said young soldiers' familiarity with technology and having Microsoft engineers close by has helped with the development of IVAS since it first started three years ago.; ""It is technology that they are used to and they become very comfortable very quickly,"" said McCarthy.; Testing is already under way on new ways to enhance IVAS, by placing cameras around armored vehicles so troops inside can have a full 360 degree view of what's happening outside.; Army leaders believe the improvements IVAS brings to training and battlefield awareness can make the difference between life and death.; ""You have the opportunity to rehearse it 50 times before you actually go on the real mission,"" said McConnville. ""I think it's going to save soldiers' lives.""","abcnews.go.com","December 18, 2020, 4:12 PM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/armys-futuristic-combat-goggles-lets-soldiers-battlefield/story?id=74791465"

If he succeeds, it would be the first time in 230 years that the process would exclude large swaths of people inside the U.S.; The Court's conservative majority, in an unsigned opinion, said the scope and impact of the president's promised action is not yet clear.; ""At present, this case is riddled with contingencies and speculation that impede judicial review,"" the Court said.; ""The President, to be sure, has made clear his desire to exclude aliens without lawful status from the apportionment base. But the President qualified his directive by providing that the Secretary should gather information 'to the extent practicable' and that aliens should be excluded 'to the extent feasible.' Any prediction how the Executive Branch might eventually implement this general statement of policy is no more than conjecture at this time,"" it said.; While the Census concluded earlier this year, the government told the Court last month that analysts at the Commerce Department, which oversees the U.S. Census Bureau, were still trying to estimate the number of undocumented immigrants in the country, including a breakdown of long-term residents and more recent arrivals.; ""The count here is complete; the present dispute involves the apportionment process, which remains at a preliminary stage,"" the Court's majority said. ""The Government's eventual action will reflect both legal and practical constraints, making any prediction about future injury just that—a prediction.""; In dismissing the challenge to Trump's plan for now, the Court made clear that it was not a decision on the merits. ""We hold only that they are not suitable for adjudication at this time,"" they said.; Justice Stephen Breyer, in a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, said they would have decided the case and ruled against Trump.; ""The Constitution specifies that the number of Representatives afforded to each State is based on an apportionment of the total population, with each State receiving its proportional share. The Government has announced a policy to exclude aliens without lawful status from the apportionment base for the decennial Census. The Government does not deny that, if carried out, the policy will harm the plaintiffs. Nor does it deny that it will implement that policy imminently,"" Breyer wrote.; ""The plain meaning of the governing statutes, decades of historical practice, and uniform interpretations from all three branches of Government demonstrate that aliens without lawful status cannot be excluded from the decennial Census solely on account of that status. The Government's effort to remove them from the apportionment base is unlawful, and I believe this Court should say so,"" he wrote.; Immigrant advocates who sued Trump over the policy stressed that the Court's move does not mean the fight is over.; ""This ruling does not authorize President Trump's goal of excluding undocumented immigrants from the Census count used to apportion the House of Representatives,"" said ACLU attorney Dale Ho. ""The legal mandate is clear -- every single person counts in the Census, and every single person is represented in Congress. If this policy is ever actually implemented, we'll be right back in court challenging it.""","abcnews.go.com","December 18, 2020, 3:14 PM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/scotus-punts-trump-bid-exclude-undocumented-immigrants-key/story?id=74801156"

His wife, Karen Pence, and Surgeon General Jerome Adams also received the vaccine. Adams had previously talked about vaccinating high-profile individuals, like presidents and public health officials, during an interview on ""Good Morning America."" ""There's a symbolic part of someone like me getting vaccinated,"" Adams said.; Dr. Anthony Fauci was also in favor. ""I will get vaccinated and I will get vaccinated publicly,"" Fauci told JAMA last week.; Offers to get vaccinated publicly isn't just political theater, according to Noel Brewer, a professor of health behavior at UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health.; While researchers believe that confidence in vaccines leads to more people getting vaccinated, increasing that confidence is tricky, Brewer explained. ""What is very effective is having leaders stand up for the vaccination system and for individual vaccines,"" he said. ""Having them offer to get vaccinated on camera is one of the single most important things that could happen.""; It's also a move with historical precedent.; In 2009, Obama rolled up his sleeve for White House photographers while getting the H1N1 vaccine. ""People need to understand that this vaccine is safe,"" he told American Urban Radio Networks at the time. ""Michelle and I just got the shots ourselves,"" he said. ""We wanted to make sure nationwide that children were getting it before adults did. And now there's enough vaccine so that adults should get it as well.""; President Gerald Ford similarly rolled up his sleeve on camera as part of his 1976 campaign to vaccinate everyone in the country after swine flu was detected at a New Jersey military base. But Ford's campaign involved fast-tracking a vaccine during an election year. When no pandemic came to pass and 30 people out of the 40 million vaccinated died from adverse reactions to the vaccine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's credibility suffered.; While Ford is a cautionary tale, Brewer pointed out that there can be damaging consequences when leaders don't stand up for vaccination.; A study Brewer published last year in the journal Vaccines, found that when authorities in Denmark were slow to respond to news stories that questioned the safety of the HPV vaccine, vaccine uptake among girls fell 14%.; Although the Danish authorities eventually stepped in, ""the periods with negative media coverage left over 26,000 older girls unvaccinated who would have otherwise received the vaccine,"" Brewer and his co-authors wrote. ""The missed doses may, over time, translate to as many as 180 avoidable cervical cancers and 45 deaths.""; In the end, combining strategies, like low-cost and accessible vaccination programs coupled with trusted public figures getting vaccinated themselves, works better than any single approach.; ""The bottom line is that this is really good news,"" Brewer said of the former presidents' vaccine pledge.; ""Trump getting vaccinated would also be very productive,"" he added.; ABC News' Benjamin Gittleson contributed to this report.; Tune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.","abcnews.go.com","December 18, 2020, 1:56 PM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/presidents-covid-vaccine-camera/story?id=74518926"
"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/afghan-worked-us-denied-visa-worker-kidnapped-unable/story?id=74715899","Afghan who worked for US denied visa after co-worker kidnapped, unable to reverify support","Mark Frerichs was kidnapped, but his silence was cited in a visa denial.","Conor Finnegan","https://abcnews.go.com/author/conor_finnegan","The gunmen at his doorstep were the final straw for ""Abdul.""; After escaping the attack -- whether they intended to kidnap or kill him was unclear -- he, his wife and four children fled Afghanistan for India, where they were granted temporary asylum. Their hope was pinned on receiving U.S. visas after his years of working for the American government in his home country, a process that had dragged on for years until he was approved in February 2019.; Another year of waiting, however, and ""Abdul,"" whose real name ABC News agreed not to use for his own safety, found out in March that his approval was rescinded. The reason, according to his lawyer and U.S. Embassy documents obtained by ABC News, was that officials were unable to recertify Abdul's letters of support from his former American employer, Mark Frerichs.; But that's because Frerichs had been kidnapped by forces aligned with the Taliban two months prior. His one chance to appeal was denied again last week, leaving him stranded in India or expelled into danger in Afghanistan.; ""I have no way out,"" Abdul told ABC News in an interview. ""Here, I am not able to have a good job, I don't have health insurance, I'm not able to send my children to school even if the lockdown finishes. In Afghanistan, my life is in high risk.""; Abdul's surreal story is one of bureaucratic nightmares that now threaten himself and his young family, left with the impossible choice of residing illegally in India or returning to Afghanistan. Amid negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government, the militant group has targeted Afghans who worked for the U.S. presence, along with police officers, students and journalists, in a recent spike in violence.; It's also symptomatic of the larger problems with the special visa programs the U.S. government created for Afghans and Iraqis who worked for the U.S. military and diplomatic missions in both countries. Critics, including several Republican and Democratic lawmakers, have accused the Trump administration of slow-walking the visas, with just seven Afghans granted visas between April and July while 157 were rejected or had their approval revoked, according to a recent report by the Homeland Security and State departments.; The State Department declined to discuss Abdul's case because ""visa records are confidential under U.S. law,"" a spokesperson said. But they cited the temporary suspension of visa services earlier this year because of COVID-19 and defended the department's processes, saying in part, ""We are committed to providing efficient and secure SIV processing while maintaining national security as our highest priority.""; Since 2006, Congress has made available a set number of special immigrant visas, or SIVs, for Afghan and Iraqi translators or for contractors who face an ""ongoing serious threat as a consequence of such employment.""; Abdul, who was born in Wardak province just west of Kabul, worked in construction. He studied engineering at Kabul University and worked for nearly a decade with U.S. firms and on projects for the State Department and U.S. military, including the Air Force and Army Corps of Engineers.; During those years, he met and worked with Frerichs, a 58-year old American engineer and U.S. Navy veteran who worked on development projects throughout Afghanistan. They worked together for four years at one firm, ""where Mark Frerichs was my supervisor and best colleague and adviser,"" Abdul said.; ""He is a very kind man, he is very friendly,"" he added of his ""friend"" Frerichs, saying that they traveled often together for projects and that he would occasionally provide Frerichs with medicine, food, supplies and warm clothes while the American was holed up in security compounds.; Frerichs disappeared in January, believed to be kidnapped by forces aligned with the Taliban, although the group has denied responsibility. The FBI has announced a reward of up to $1 million for information leading to his release, and senior U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, have publicly called for his release in recent months, as U.S. troops draw down from the country.; Like Frerichs, Abdul's years of work for the U.S. endangered his life. Over the years, other Afghan and American colleagues and friends were attacked, kidnapped or killed, including a blast near his work site in May 2017 that left him with lung problems, and an attack on his firm's senior management in February 2018 that injured several people.; By that point, Abdul had already applied for a U.S. visa, submitting an application in December 2016. His hope had been that his work with the U.S. government, which also imperiled his life, would now afford him a lifesaving opportunity -- allowing him and his wife to bring their children to America to raise them here.; ""During the time I was working with [Abdul] as his co-worker/supervisor, I have found him to be a dedicated and hardworking company member. He displayed exceptional work ethics,"" Frerichs wrote in his letter of support in July 2017. A copy of his passport was included in Abdul's application, along with other evidence of their work together, and the two exchanged emails as recently as October 2019, with Frerichs promising to ""do what I can to assist"" the delay in Abdul's visa.; SIV applications must first be approved by a team at the U.S. Embassy and then the chief of mission. From there, an applicant applies formally for a visa through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, is interviewed and can be accepted. The lengthy process, with many layers of required paperwork, can be difficult to navigate, especially for the majority of applicants who don't have a lawyer.; But in April 2018, weeks after receiving chief of mission approval, Abdul couldn't wait any longer for the process to unfold. Two gunmen came to his house, seeking to kidnap or kill him, he said: ""They wanted to kill me because we were not cooperating with insurgents. ... I no longer felt safe.""; He and his family escaped into hiding and, shortly afterward, fled to India and into ambiguity -- unauthorized to work, unable to send his children to school and unclear about how long his asylum status would last there.; ""I cannot explain it. It's really hard for me to be here in an uncertain situation,"" he said.; Throughout that time, he worked diligently, but with growing frustration, on acquiring a visa. The embassy verified his letter from Frerichs, at times asking him to provide staff in Delhi other documents, like a medical evaluation. In February 2019, he was conditionally approved by USCIS and completed his embassy interview four months later -- then was left again to wait.; But last March, he was hit with the sharp shock of rejection, his approval suddenly rescinded. ""You did not provide a valid letter of recommendation with your application,"" the embassy said in a letter.; Lawyers from the International Refugee Assistance Project, or IRAP, a legal nonprofit based in New York, said that National Visa Center staff twice told them that Abdul's approval was withdrawn ""solely"" because the office couldn't reverify Frerichs' letter.; ""That was a clear and obvious mistake. ... They never contacted me. They never asked me that there was something missing or any information is required to get rectified or revised,"" Abdul said.; IRAP worked with Abdul to file an appeal to the U.S. Embassy, pointing out the obvious difficulty in reverifying a letter from someone who's been kidnapped and including two new letters from a second and third American supervisor, one of whom had already supported his application in his 2016 submission.; But last Friday, he was informed that it was also rejected -- with the same citation: ""You did not submit a valid letter of recommendation."" They also rejected the new letters by saying his employment under those supervisors didn't meet ""the requirement of at least two years of employment by or on behalf of the U.S. government.""; SIV applicants only have one opportunity to appeal, seemingly leaving Abdul's application at a dead end. IRAP lawyers are consulting on what other options remain, including starting the process all over again.; But for Abdul, his future is not his focus. In text messages, just hours after finding out the news his appeal had been rejected, he told ABC News he was ""very disappointed,"" but wanted to help secure Frerichs' release now.; ""Just as my brother, his life is very important, more important than anything, no matter how reckless the [chief of mission] is,"" he said. ""I'm still honestly proud for my 10 years of service with the U.S. government and being Mark's close colleague for years and his trusted friend for almost nine years.""; ""Please keep [pushing] awareness about my missing friend, colleague and supervisor Mark Frerichs,"" he added. ""I will be sending prayers as always for his safety and soon release.""","abcnews.go.com","December 18, 2020, 12:15 PM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/afghan-worked-us-denied-visa-worker-kidnapped-unable/story?id=74715899"

Few, least of all Biden and his team, are mistaking positive signs for a breakthrough of bipartisanship -- certainly not so long as President Donald Trump's grip on the GOP continues.; Something else that made this week stand out: Trump has said almost nothing in public. He'll make plenty of noise over the next month, but a post-Trump world might be coming into view.; The RUNDOWN with MaryAlice Parks; Biden sent a strong message Thursday with his latest Cabinet picks.; If confirmed as his secretary of interior, New Mexico Congresswoman Deb Halaand would be the first Native American to lead the agency responsible for interfacing between the federal government and tribes.; Halaand is a member of the Pueblo of Laguna, and the move signals a potential turning point in our nation's history, a fundamental shift in how Indigenous people and their governments may be able to relate back to Washington.; The Department of Interior is one of the county's oldest agencies and with responsibility over parks, public lands and natural resources. Closely tied to the progressive movement, Haaland is expected to pivot the agency away from fossil fuel development and toward combatting climate change, too.; Voters from Navajo Nation played a pivotal role in delivering the swing state of Arizona for Biden and, in one way, the decision could also be seen as an acknowledgement of how diverse voters from Indian country coast-to-coast helped him win in November.; The TIP with Molly Nagle; President-elect Joe Biden is continuing to roll out his ""cabinet of firsts"", filling 18 roles of what he promises will be ""the most representative of any Cabinet in American history.""; ""We'll have more people of color than any Cabinet ever. We'll have more women than any Cabinet ever. We'll have a Cabinet of barrier breakers,"" Biden said Wednesday at an event introducing one of those barrier breakers, former 2020 rival Pete Buttigieg, who would be the first openly gay U.S. Cabinet secretary if confirmed by the Senate for secretary of transportation.; Biden has already delivered on those metrics with a new slate of climate nominees announced Thursday night, which also include Haaland. To date, Biden's Cabinet picks include 11 persons of color and 10 women. If all are confirmed, he would beat the previous records of diversity held by President Barack Obama, who had 10 persons of color in his Cabinet, and Bill Clinton, who had nine women serve in his Cabinet during his second term.; With five positions yet to be named, those margins could increase, but the historic pick could also give Biden leeway when naming his remaining positions, including his attorney general, for which outgoing Alabama Sen.

President Donald Trump has been the sun around which our political and cultural thinking has orbited for the past five years. According to one count, more than 1,200 books were written about Trump during his first term in office, compared to 500 books about President Barack Obama during a similar period. After all that coverage, what did we actually learn? To answer that question, in this installment of the FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast, Galen Druke speaks with Carlos Lozada, the nonfiction book critic at The Washington Post.

They share the same water and each town's fire department will jump in to help out if there's trouble.; It's been almost nine months since the land border shut and crossings were limited to essential travel only due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Single passport citizens can't cross unless they are performing essential work and dual citizens must quarantine for two weeks on either side, making casual back-and-forth trips impossible.; Officials have not even given a timetable for when the limits will be removed.; ""Until the virus is significantly under more control everywhere around the world, we are not going to be releasing the restrictions at the border,"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently said in a radio interview with Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.; For this tiny remote community, and others like it along the international boundary, the new reality is devastating.; ""I'm now starting to have lonely feelings and I miss them,"" Vermont grandmother Wendy Bronson told ABC News. ""And with the holidays coming, it's worse.""; Bronson said she has lived along the international line her whole of life. Her days have always included frequent back and forth trips. Her dentist and dermatologist are in Canada. Her job involves visiting nearby Canadian stores. Some of her children and grandchildren live less than 20 miles away in Canada.; ""You just kind of take it for granted, don't you?"" she said. ""There has been this open space all my life that was just the, 'Hi, how're you doing, Mrs. Bronson?' at the border.""; Even though members of Bronson's family are dual citizens and can legally cross, they are subject to strictly monitored 14-day quarantines that neither can afford to do regularly.; ""I have to remind myself that I'm better off than some and not get on the pity party,"" she said. ""That is really hard when you're close to your family and you see them on a regular basis, three or four times a week, and then you can't see them. FaceTime does not cut that, you know, it doesn't cut it.""; Bronson started to choke up: ""I was shut off from my family ... and I can't get to my kids if they need me. They can't get to me if they need me.""; Small business owner Jane McIntyre runs Jane's Cafe, a three-minute walk from the border in Derby Line. She said her business is taking a big hit from the border closure.; ""Normally, this road would be very busy because of all the cars coming through,"" she said as she stands outside her quiet cafe. She said most of her customers aren't ""regulars,"" but instead cross-border travelers on their way to either country.; ""I think I could probably survive until next fall -- September, October -- and then I think I would have to give up if it doesn't change,"" she said.; Patrol agent in charge of Newport Station Erik Lavallee said he understands the community's frustration. He's worked this section of the border for more than 16 years and said many of his agents are active in the community.; ""We're in the middle of a pandemic. Unfortunately, the pandemic does not know borders. It does not keep itself to one community or another,"" Lavallee told ABC News. ""We're trying to minimize any impact to our local communities and health care resources, and maintain what we do have for the safety and security of our citizens.""; He said there have been instances of people meeting outside the Haskell Library, an area where the boundary is marked by a row of potted plants. But, he said, he discourages it.; ""There have been plenty of instances where we've come across folks that are much less than 6 feet. No masks, and especially coming from other parts of the United States, not quarantining prior to meeting up with family members,"" he explained.; ""So from our perspective, in order to keep the community safe and my agents, my personnel here, safe, we're trying to limit the meetings as best as we can.""; There are others with strong American and Canadian ties facing a similar struggle. Two months ago, Devon Weber -- an American living in Montreal with her Canadian husband -- started a Facebook group called ""Let Us Reunite."" She said it has already grown to more than 1,500 families, many of whom are from border communities. She is now leading the organization's efforts to start lobbying the U.S. government.; ""The Canadian government has twice passed family travel exemptions,"" Weber told ABC News. ""We're asking for reciprocal family travel exemption so our Canadian family can travel to the United States.""; Her team also advocates amending land border restrictions because she said there's a loophole: Canadians can fly into the U.S. for nonessential reasons, but not drive, specifically hurting border communities.; ""People that live five minutes apart now have to take four airplanes, spend $1,000 and travel 10 hours to see their loved ones,"" she said. ""That just seems ridiculous to me.""; Rep. Brian Higgins, D-N.Y., represents border communities in northern New York. He calls the policy ""a disconnect.""; ""We should expect that the Department of Homeland Security in the United States and our public health officials in Canada would work to create parity as to who can come and how, what mode of transportation they can use. That disparity is not helpful,"" Higgins told ABC News.; He said Buffalo and western New York sees 80% of their sales tax revenues on the weekends from Canadian shoppers. He also said Canadians spend $10 million a year on health services in the area and 40% of people flying out of Buffalo's airport are Canadian. His district feels this acutely.; But, he added, ""The only thing that you can do without a vaccine, without a treatment, is to do all the things that are necessary to drive down the number of COVID-19 cases you have.""; And that means keeping the border closed.; The US Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately respond for comment.; For now, McIntyre, of Jane's Cafe, said she is keeping focused on her internal mantra as she tries to make her way through this unprecedented time.; ""The best thing in my life that I can always do is keep putting one foot in front of the other,"" she said.; ""Do what you need to do that day to make yourself and everybody around you feel better,"" McIntyre continued. ""And the rest will have to work itself out.""","abcnews.go.com","December 18, 2020, 4:31 AM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/countries-stay-locked-us-canadian-border-communities-struggle/story?id=74723130"

Raphael Warnock appeared on ABC's ""The View"" on Thursday and talked about the high stakes in the Georgia Senate runoff races.; ""It's difficult to overstate how much is at stake here,"" Warnock said, calling the Jan. 5 election ""a defining moment in America.""; The two runoff races in Georgia between Warnock and Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler, as well as, Republican Sen. David Perdue and Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff, have become a political centerfold as the future of the Senate rests on who will win in Georgia.; Democrats need to win both seats to control the Senate. If Warnock and Ossoff win, each party will have 50 seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will be the tiebreaker.; When ""The View"" co-host Joy Behar asked Warnock about Loeffler supporting Trump's unproven claims of voter fraud and efforts to overturn election results in Georgia, Warnock called Loeffler's action ""undemocratic"" and ""disappointing"" to the people in his state.; On Wednesday, Loeffler declined to rule out the possibility of joining a Republican effort to overturn Biden's win when Congress meets to formally certify the Electoral College vote on Jan. 6.; ""Kelly Loeffler is consistent. She's always focused on what's good for her, and she's demonstrated now that she's willing to wage war against the voices of the very people she's supposed to be representing,"" Warnock said.; ""Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are clearly the president-elect and vice president-elect of the United States,"" Warnock continued, noting that the Georgia presidential election results were audited and then recounted after the election.; ""We've had three counts of the vote. The vote has been certified twice and the Electoral College confirmed that a couple of days ago. And now she's leaving open the option that she would perhaps challenge it in Congress. I think it's undemocratic. It's un-American, and it's unfortunate.""; In a one-minute ad jointly produced by the Ossoff and Warnock campaigns, President-elect Joe Biden urged Georgia voters to turn out for Democrats on Jan. 5 and made clear that the success of his White House agenda will be determined by the future of the Senate.; ""Let me be clear: I need Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff in the United States Senate to get this done,"" Biden warned. ""There are folks in Congress threatening to do everything in their power to block our efforts,"" Biden said in the ad, which debuted Thursday Morning.; The ad comes after Biden campaigned in person for Warnock and Ossoff on Tuesday.; ""I need two senators from this state if I want to get something done, not two senators who are going to get in the way, because, look, getting nothing just hurts Georgia,"" Biden said during the rally.; President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and other high-profile Republicans have stumped in Georgia during Loeffler and Perdue's joint campaign effort.; At her events, Loeffler has repeatedly called Warnock a ""radical liberal,"" telling her supporters he will support a socialist agenda and empower the influence of progressive Democrats like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.; When asked about Loeffler's attacks, Warnock told ""The View"" co-host Sunny Hostin that he can't be distracted by his opponent's attacks.; ""Kelly is trying to change the subject. She cannot justify why she still has that seat,"" Warnock said, accusing Loeffler of enriching herself as her Georgia constituents struggled during the coronavirus pandemic.; Over the summer, the Department of Justice and the Senate Ethics Committee dropped its respective investigations into stock trades made by Loeffler, James Inhofe, R-Okla., and Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., shortly before markets plummeted amid the coronavirus.; Warnock contrasted himself as a candidate who would prioritize the interests of Georgians and attempted to set the record straight on the issues he supports.; ""I know who I am. I'm someone who believes in our democratic system. I believe in the nonviolent transfer of power and actually honoring the voices of people. ... And I believe in a free enterprise system,"" Warnock said.","abcnews.go.com","December 18, 2020, 2:32 AM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/difficult-overstate-stake-warnock/story?id=74725230"

The coalition stressed aviation employees should be vaccinated after healthcare workers and vulnerable populations.; “We are not asking for aviation workers to be on top of the list, but we need governments to ensure that transportation workers are considered as essential when vaccine roll-out plans are developed, Alexandre de Juniac, director general and CEO of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade association of the world’s airlines, said in a press release.; Airlines for America, an industry trade organization that represents major U.S. airlines, said because carriers are being called upon to distribute the coronavirus vaccines “it is critical that our employees are on the job and ready to assist.”; The Airports Council International (ACI), a global trade association representing airports worldwide, echoed this, saying airport workers are “frontline staff” who are in daily contact with the traveling public, and the aviation industry is key to “driving the recovery from the pandemic through the movement of essential goods, including, of course, the vaccines.”; “As the global roll-out of vaccines commences, it is clear that the most vulnerable in our society and those key healthcare workers who are doing so much to keep us all safe and healthy are prioritized for vaccination,” ACI World Director General Luis Felipe de Oliveira said. “As this crucial group is vaccinated, it is then important for other key groups are prioritized to receive the vaccines so they can support a global recovery from the pandemic.”; “Air transportation will be essential to fight back against the virus and return to normal, even if it is a new normal,” the letter said.; ABC News' Stephanie Ebbs contributed to this report.","abcnews.go.com","December 17, 2020, 11:18 PM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/aviation-workers-essential-workers-vaccinated-lobbyists/story?id=74785499"

It gives us hope that one day in the not-too-distant future, some semblance of normalcy will be within our reach,"" said Robert Wong, a physician at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Healthcare System, who spoke during a public comment session.; Wong urged the panel and federal regulators to be ""particularly cognizant"" of ensuring equitable access among underserved and vulnerable populations that ""have been disproportionately exacerbated by this pandemic.""; The independent panel of advisers was asked to vote on this question: ""Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals 18 and older?""; The panel voted in favor, 20-0, with one abstention, to recommend the vaccine.; The questions of allergies were raised, following reports of rare reactions to the Pfizer vaccine, including two in Alaska on Wednesday.; Dr. Doran Fink, a senior vaccine official at the FDA, said researchers didn't have all the information. But he noted that ""these cases underscore the need to be vigilant during the early stage of the campaign"" and communicate those findings to the public.; Fink said the FDA was working with Pfizer to further revise fact sheets and warnings to health care providers to make clear that any facility administering it ""should ensure that medical treatment for managing serious allergic reactions is immediately available."" He said the FDA plans to do the same for Moderna, if it is ultimately authorized as expected.; If authorized, the 5.9 million doses shipped from Moderna would be in addition to the 6.4 million doses provided by Pfizer-BioNTech that started to roll out this week after being the first to get emergency use authorization.; Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said Wednesday that people shouldn't be concerned about having to choose between Moderna and Pfizer. An internal assessment by the FDA already found that the Moderna data show the benefits likely outweigh the risks.; ""Moderna certainly will be available soon and have the same level of efficacy ... the same safety profile and virtually everything the same about that. So it wouldn't make much difference which of those you take,"" Fauci told CNBC's ""Health Returns.""; One primary difference is that Moderna requires fewer specific handling instructions because it does not require ultra-cold storage conditions like the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.; Moderna also is seeking authorization for ages 18 and older, whereas Pfizer's enrollment of older teens in trials this fall paved the way for authorization of anyone 16-plus.; Which sites get the first doses are being decided by state governors and health departments. As recommended by an ethics board, hospitals have been first in line, injecting front-line workers most likely to come in contact with the virus.; Nursing homes also are the priority, although they have been slower to roll out shots because they rely on CVS, Walgreens and other pharmacies that say the logistics are considerable to ensure no dose is wasted.; Florida and West Virginia were among the first to host vaccine clinics at nursing homes on Wednesday, with a nationwide rollout at long-term care facilities expected on Monday.; By February, it's expected that other seniors living independently – anyone over age 65 – will be able to ask their pharmacy for a vaccination.; ""Our plans is to be able to immunize 100 million of these people (with) those vaccines by the end of the first quarter of the year 2021, somewhere during the month of March,"" Moncef Slaoui, Trump's top science adviser in the vaccine effort, told CNBC.; A third vaccine also is on the horizon. Johnson & Johnson was expected by early January to know whether its vaccine was effective. If that vaccine comes online as well, that ""will help us accelerate even faster coverage of that population,"" Slaoui said.; Estimates for the broader population remains March or April, with immunizations complete by June.; ""By the time we get into mid, fall of 2021, we can be approaching some level of normality,"" he said.; ""I would think that would be things like being able to go to theaters, clearly feeling much more comfortable about school, having restaurants open to indoor dining,"" Fauci said.; This report was featured in the Thursday, Dec. 17, 2020, episode of ""Start Here,"" ABC News' daily news podcast.; ""Start Here"" offers a straightforward look at the day's top stories in 20 minutes.

But a good defense isn’t enough; we need to disrupt and deter our adversaries from undertaking significant cyber attacks in the first place,” Biden said, noting his team would implement stronger punitive measures for those who carry out any such attacks on the U.S.; “Our adversaries should know that, as President, I will not stand idly by in the face of cyber assaults on our nation,” Biden said.; The intrusion involves software from SolarWinds, which makes IT management tools, that had been adulterated or “Trojanized” with a vulnerability that could be exploited by hackers to steal information, manipulate systems or plant trap doors and other exploits for future use.; The FBI, Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence called the intrusion a ""significant and ongoing cybersecurity campaign.""; ""The FBI is investigating and gathering intelligence in order to attribute, pursue, and disrupt the responsible threat actors,"" the agency's statement said. “The FBI is engaging with known and suspected victims, and information gained through FBI’s efforts will provide indicators to network defenders and intelligence to our government partners to enable further action.”; The three agencies established a Cyber Unified Coordination Group on Tuesday and will work ""to coordinate a whole-of-government response to this significant cyber incident.""; The statement reiterated that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), under the Department of Homeland Security, is the lead agency in helping secure companies and agencies affected.; Two government officials told ABC News that Russia is believed to be behind the attack that has so far compromised the Department of Homeland Security, State Department, National Institute of Health, Commerce and Treasury Departments.; National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien cut an international trip short in order to return to the United States to address the cyberbreach of U.S. government computer networks, according to the White House’s National Security Council.; A person familiar with the matter confirmed that there has been at least one NSC meeting to discuss the situation.; The Russians have denied they are behind the attack, and while Trump hasn't commented, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany asked on Tuesday about the breaches said the U.S. government was “taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to the situation.”; One lawmaker briefed on the intrusion said what they saw was troubling.; ""Stunning,"" Sen.

""The access the Russians now enjoy could be used for far more than simply spying.""; Bossert also asserts that trying to pick up the pieces after this intrusion could be very difficult.; ""The remediation effort alone will be staggering. It will require the segregated replacement of entire enclaves of computers, network hardware and servers across vast federal and corporate networks,"" Bossert said. ""Somehow, the nation’s sensitive networks have to remain operational despite unknown levels of Russian access and control. A “do over” is mandatory and entire new networks need to be built — and isolated from compromised networks. Cyber threat hunters that are stealthier than the Russians must be unleashed on these networks to look for the hidden, persistent access controls. These information security professionals actively search for, isolate and remove advanced, malicious code that evades automated safeguards. This will be difficult work as the Russians will be watching every move on the inside,"" he warned.; Cyberexperts concur with Bossert’s assertion that this hack could potentially be incredibly damaging.; “The potential for damage here is full compromise of the environment, including theft of sensitive materials,” Tony Turner, Vice President for Security Solutions for Fortress Security Solutions, told ABC News.; On Monday, SolarWinds said as many as 18,000 organizations including unclassified federal government networks and 425 Fortune 500 companies could have downloaded the malicious software, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.; ""We believe that this vulnerability is the result of a highly-sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by a nation state. We are acting in close coordination with FireEye, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the intelligence community, and other law enforcement to investigate these matters,"" SolarWinds President and CEO Kevin Thompson said on Sunday.; Over the weekend, CISA, assessed there is “high potential for compromises of agency information systems,” and the potential “grave impact of a successful compromise,” in affected systems and for only the fifth time in the agency’s history issued an emergency directive “to review their networks for indicators of compromise and disconnect or power down SolarWinds Orion products immediately.”; CISA is operating with an acting director after President Trump fired director Chris Krebs in November.; ""The compromise of SolarWinds’ Orion Network Management Products poses unacceptable risks to the security of federal networks,"" said CISA acting Director Brandon Wales.; Javed Ali, a former senior counterterrorism director on the National Security Council and former FBI official said that Russia has not been deterred by the United States previous response to Russians meddling in US systems.; ""It raises serious questions about the level of US defensive measures against cyber-attacks, as the vulnerabilities exploited in this latest attack crossed over into both private industry cyber tools and federal ones--neither of which were able to identify the Russian breaches until months after they began,"" he explained.; ABC News' Molly Nagle contributed to this report.; This report was featured in the Friday, Dec. 18, 2020, episode of “Start Here,” ABC News’ daily news podcast.; ""Start Here"" offers a straightforward look at the day's top stories in 20 minutes.

Pro-Trump attorneys have filed more than 60 lawsuits as part of the effort, nearly all of which have been dismissed, often with sharply-worded rulings.; Despite having been repeatedly disputed by the company and disproven by federal election officials, the bogus conspiracy theory has spread fast and wide on social media and in conservative media outlets.; Powell made the claims in the pages of post-election federal lawsuits filed in four states, all of which were forcefully rejected by judges.; ""While you are entitled to your own opinions, Ms. Powell, you are not entitled to your own facts,"" Dominion attorney Thomas A.

""For the safety of Dominion's employees and for the sake of the truth and confidence in American democracy, we demand that you immediately and publicly retract your false accusations and set the record straight.""; Dominion's voting machines are used in 28 states across the country, some of which were won by Trump in this year's election.; Numerous legal experts have told ABC News the legal effort to overturn results in the 2020 presidential election bordered on abusive. This week the attorney general in Pennsylvania said he was looking into sanctions against attorneys who brought nearly two dozen election lawsuits in the state.; ""Attorneys who try to disenfranchise Pennsylvania voters based on frivolous allegations should be held accountable,"" a spokesperson for Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro told ABC News. ""We're continuing to explore our options and will not hesitate to take action if we conclude it is warranted.""; ABC News has not received a response from Powell about the Dominion letter.; Powell, who rose to prominence last year defending Trump's embattled former national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, was publicly removed from the Trump legal team earlier this month after her claims began veering into far more conspiratorial territory. But Trump has continued to embrace her legal efforts on social media.; ABC News' Ali Dukakis contributed to this report.","abcnews.go.com","December 17, 2020, 7:23 PM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/voting-machine-firm-demands-pro-trump-attorney-retract/story?id=74783255"
"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-absent-biden-pence-plan-vaccinated/story?id=74779221","Trump absent as Biden, Pence plan to get vaccinated","The president indicated he wouldn't get a vaccine anytime soon.","Ben Gittleson","https://abcnews.go.com/author/ben_gittleson","President Donald Trump wasn't expected to join Vice President Mike Pence and President-elect Joe Biden in the coming days when they get vaccinated for COVID-19, a decision that could be tied to the recommendation to wait 90 days after he received a certain treatment during his COVID-19 illness -- but also one that hasn’t been fully explained to the public.; Trump has remained mostly absent from public view since the announcement that the nation’s first vaccine was to be distributed across the country. While he has repeatedly endorsed the benefit of vaccines in recent months, it remains an open question whether he will personally take it.; Trump, who is presumed to have some degree of immunity to the coronavirus after contracting it this fall, indicated this week he would not get vaccinated a vaccine anytime soon. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that even those who have recovered receive the vaccine.; While the White House cited his prior illness -- as well as, it said, his desire not to jump ahead of healthcare workers and residents and workers in long-term care facilities, whom the CDC has recommended get inoculated first -- it did not mention that a specific COVID-19 treatment he received in October, a monoclonal antibody cocktail, may place him in a category the CDC recommends should hold off.; In contrast, Pence and Biden planned to get inoculated publicly in the coming days.; The CDC recommended this month that the first available doses go to front-line health care workers and residents and workers in long-term care facilities, although it was ultimately up to state and regional leaders to decide how to distribute the limited supply of doses available so far. The defense department and several other federal government agencies received doses, too.; Public health officials and experts have argued it could be beneficial for public figures -- including prominent politicians -- to get jabbed before cameras, in order to convince Americans who remain skeptical about the COVID-19 vaccines, which are being produced in record time. One version was authorized for emergency use for the first time in the United States late last week.; Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal government's top infectious disease expert, said in an interview with ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Tuesday that he thought Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris should also get vaccinated to protect national security.; ""For security reasons, I really feel strongly that we should get them vaccinated as soon as we possibly can,"" Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said. ""You want him fully protected as he enters into the presidency in January. So that would be my strong recommendation.""; Fauci, who advises the current administration and also plans to serve as Biden's chief medical adviser on the pandemic, said he thought Trump and Pence should get inoculated, too.; ""If he were asking me, I would recommend that he do that, as well as Vice President Pence,"" Fauci said in an interview with ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos. ""You still want to protect people who are, you know, very important to our country right now. Even though the president himself was infected and he has, likely, antibodies that likely would be protective, we're not sure how long that protection lasts. So to be doubly sure, I would recommend that he get vaccinated, as well as the vice president.""; Compared to Biden and Pence, Trump finds himself in a unique position after having fallen ill with the coronavirus. Those who have recovered are believed to have some level of protection, although the strength and length of such protection remains a subject of study, and the CDC recommends that even people who have tested positive for COVID-19 in the past get vaccinated.; Aside from his presumed immunity, Trump actually falls into a category of people for whom the CDC suggests delaying vaccination.; As part of his treatment for COVID-19 in early October, the president received a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies produced by the pharmaceutical company Regeneron; he became one of only roughly 10 people at the time who had gotten it outside of clinical trials.; The CDC recommends that those who received that treatment wait 90 days before getting vaccinated.; ""Based on the estimated half-life of such therapies as well as evidence suggesting that reinfection is uncommon in the 90 days after initial infection,"" CDC guidelines read, ""vaccination should be deferred for at least 90 days, as a precautionary measure until additional information becomes available, to avoid interference of the antibody treatment with vaccine-induced immune responses.""; White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, though, did not cite that specific reason as a factor this week when she explained Trump's decision to delay his inoculation, and the White House on Thursday did not respond to a question about whether it had played a role.; Instead, speaking to reporters at a news conference Tuesday, McEnany cited the immunity he was already believed to have from his illness and treatment.; And, she said, the president wanted to ""set an example"" by sending the message that ""our long-term care facility residents and front-line workers are paramount in importance.""; Trump said Sunday that he had yet to be ""scheduled"" to get vaccinated.; ""I am not scheduled to take the vaccine,"" Trump tweeted, ""but look forward to doing so at the appropriate time.""; A Biden transition team official told ABC News that the president-elect was expected to receive the vaccine as soon as next week.; ""It's important that people who are in the greatest need get it,"" Biden said last month. ""I wouldn't hesitate to get the vaccine. But I also want to set an example.""; Pence, the leader of the White House's coronavirus task force, planned to get vaccinated before cameras on Friday alongside his wife, Karen, in order ""to promote the safety and efficacy of the vaccine and build confidence among the American people,"" according to the vice president's office.; When recommending Pence get vaccinated, the vice president's White House physician also considered the need to protect his health as a way of ensuring continuity of government, according to an official in Pence's office.; While McEnany said Trump wanted ""to make sure that the vulnerable get access first"" -- and that Trump was ""very open to taking this, but wants to prioritize our front-line workers"" -- in announcing Pence's plans, the vice president's office did not address this concern.; His team has tried to maximize coverage of the shots -- working with television networks to ensure live coverage on Friday -- and, according to the official, including the second lady was aimed at convincing skeptical Republicans in particular.; In polls, Republicans have consistently been less willing to get the vaccine than Democrats or independents have been. The official said Karen Pence's appearance could illustrate a familial element to making a decision to get vaccinated.; Surgeon General Jerome Adams planned to get jabbed alongside them, too. Adams, who is Black, has been outspoken at convincing the Black community -- which has also expressed heightened skepticism -- to get inoculated, and the official said Adams planned to double down on that message Friday.; Earlier this week, acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller also got vaccinated publicly, in order to show military service members the vaccine was safe. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, too, got a shot before cameras.; While Trump briefly voiced support for vaccines on Twitter Thursday, he has remained out of public view during a historic week for the pandemic -- marked by the beginning of mass inoculations and by record-high death tolls.; ""The Vaccine and the Vaccine rollout are getting the best of reviews,"" Trump tweeted Thursday morning. ""Moving along really well. Get those 'shots' everyone!""; But otherwise, he has left the public encouragement to his deputies and the incoming administration.; Trump has maintained a light public schedule since losing reelection last month. Always focused on optics, Trump's absence from view this week was notable considering he had for months been touting the benefits of vaccines.; He also has not commented on the record-high death tolls in recent days.; A daily high of 3,656 Americans were reported dead from COVID-19 on Wednesday, according to Johns Hopkins University.; ABC News' Anne Flaherty and Molly Nagle contributed to this report.","abcnews.go.com","December 17, 2020, 6:53 PM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-absent-biden-pence-plan-vaccinated/story?id=74779221"
"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mcconnell-covid-19-relief-deal-payments-individuals-businesses/story?id=74780339","McConnell says pandemic relief deal with aid to individuals, businesses is 'close'","It's expected to include up to $600 in direct payments to Americans.","Mariam Khan","https://abcnews.go.com/author/mariam_khan","​Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, speaking on the Senate floor Thursday, said he believes a ""bipartisan, bicameral agreement appears to be close at hand"" on a COVID-19 relief deal.; ""I’m encouraged that our Democratic colleagues have now embraced this framework, that’s been the right solution for our country all this time,"" he said.; Lawmakers are working furiously to announce a $900 billion deal ahead of a government funding deadline at midnight Friday, but McConnell warned senators that a short-term funding bill is expected and that it is ""highly likely"" senators will have to work through the weekend to finish both bills: one for COVID-19 relief and the other a massive $1.4 trillion spending bill.; While a COVID-19 relief deal still must be finalized, it's expected to include $300 billion for the small business loan program, money for vaccine distribution and testing, education funds, and up to $600 in one-time direct payments for Americans on a sliding scale depending on income levels.; The deal would extend the eviction moratorium and reinstate a federal unemployment insurance supplement, potentially at $300 per week.; The stakes are incredibly high for members of Congress to strike a deal ahead of the new year.; Twelve million people are set to lose benefits if pandemic-era provisions to expand unemployment eligibility expire. Millions across the country could face eviction if a federal moratorium expires at the end of the year.; All this comes as the rising number of COVID-19 cases are taking a toll on the economy: the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits rose again last week to 885,000 - the highest weekly total since September.; On Thursday morning, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters the top lawmakers are making headway.; ""We made some progress this morning, we are waiting to hear back, but that’s it,"" Pelosi said. Asked if a deal could be announced as soon as Thursday, she responded: ""We'll let you know.""; Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer held several calls with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin into Wednesday night, according Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill. He said they would speak again Thursday morning.; “All three emphasized the urgency to reaching an immediate agreement,” he wrote in a tweet.; The new COVID-19 relief legislation would ""repurpose"" over $400 billion in unused funds from the CARES Act, which Congress passed back in March - which means this bill will be about $500 billion in new funding if the $900 billion top-line holds.; Democrats acknowledged defeat in getting $160 billion in aid for state and local governments in the deal due to Republican opposition.; “It’s heartbreaking for us,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said Wednesday.; At the same time, McConnell has agreed to set aside liability protections for businesses, which he had said was a ""red line"" for Republicans.; There are still some unresolved issues as well, senators have said, including funding for nutritional assistance, or SNAP benefits.; ""I think there’s general, you know, disagreement on a temporary SNAP increase. So we just have to work out the details and there’s other issues to make sure we’re supporting food banks and other ways to get food to people,"" Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., told reporters Thursday.; Lawmakers are also still haggling over how much funding to include in the bill that would provide targeted support for the restaurant industry and independent live music venue operators, as thousands of businesses struggle to stay afloat after their doors were shuttered due to the raging pandemic.; The COVID-19 relief bill is expected to be attached to a larger omnibus spending deal. McConnell said negotiators are on the ""one-yard line"" in finalizing the spending bill.; ""We are no strangers to December cliffhangers,"" McConnell said, adding that government funding ""hangs in the balance.""; ""In the next few days, Congress will either succeed or fail at providing secure and stable funding,"" McConnell said.; He said he is open to passing a short-term funding bill to get the it done.; ""We’re going to stay right here, right here, until we’re finished. Even if that means working through the weekend, which is highly likely,"" McConnell said.; McConnell closed his remarks with a subtle warning to negotiators, saying, ""in my judgment, we're very close to a point that arises in every major negotiation. It's the point where each side faces a fork in the road,"" McConnell said.; ""In short, we're near the point in this process where we decide if we're going to stay on the fast track or drift back toward business as usual,"" McConnell said. ""I say the answer should be obvious.""; On the Senate floor, Schumer signaled that agreement on a COVID-19 bill is close.; ""We are putting the final touches on what would be the largest stimulus bill in the history of our country, with the exception of the CARES Act ... none of the remaining hurdles can not be overcome,"" he said.","abcnews.go.com","December 17, 2020, 6:01 PM","https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mcconnell-covid-19-relief-deal-payments-individuals-businesses/story?id=74780339"
