Biden blasts Trump over suspected Russian cyberattack on fed agencies
FOX News correspondent Mark Meredith has the latest from Washington on 'Special Report'
President-elect Joe Biden says he won’t roll back President Trump’s immigration restrictions ""on day one,"" but rather would take approximately six months to implement immigration reform policies in order to prevent triggering a surge of ""2 million people on our border.""
""I’ve already started discussing these issues with the president of Mexico and our friends in Latin America and the timeline is to do it so that we in fact make it better, not worse,"" the president-elect said Tuesday when asked during a press conference about the timetable for his immigration policy implementation.
OMAR BLASTS BIDEN TEAM ‘BAIT AND SWITCH’ AFTER OFFICIALS SAY UNDOING TRUMP IMMIGRATION POLICY WILL ‘TAKE TIME’
Amid an increasing number of immigrants being detained at the nation’s southern border since his presidential election victory over President Trump last month, Biden emphasized that ""the last thing we need is to say we’re going to stop immediately the, you know, the access to asylum the way it’s being run now and end up with 2 million people on our border.""

Biden’s vowed to scrap the Trump administration’s policy which mandates that most Central Americans trying to migrate to the U.S. stay in Mexico while their asylum claims are being reviewed. 
BIDEN SAYS CYBERATTACK HAPPENED ON 'TRUMP'S WATCH WHEN HE WASN'T WATCHING'
The president-elect, speaking to reporters during a pre-holiday speech and question and answer session in his hometown of Wilmington, Del., said it would take time to implement the changes because ""it’s a matter of setting up the guardrails.""
But he pledged ""I will accomplish what I said I would do: A much more humane policy based on family unification. But it requires getting a lot in place. It requires getting the funding in place, including just asylum judges, for example.""
""It will get done and it will get done quickly. But it’s not going to be able to be done on day one, lift every restriction that exists and go back to what it was 20 years ago and all of a sudden find we have a crisis on our hands that complicates what we’re trying to do,"" he explained.
Biden said that ""it is going to take probably the next six months.""
The president-elect’s comments came the day after Susan Rice and Jake Sullivan, his incoming domestic policy and national security advisers, respectively, told the Spanish wire service EFE that changes to the U.S. immigration system would ""take time"" and migrants should not expect the border to be ""fully open"" right away.
Those comments sparked Rep. Ilhan Omar , D-MN to accuse the Biden team of breaking a ""core campaign promise.""
""This is a classic bait and switch,"" the ""Squad"" member wrote on Twitter a couple of hours before Biden spoke on Tuesday. ""It perpetuates Trump’s dehumanization of migrants and breaks a core campaign promise. Democrats lose big when administrations won’t fulfill their promise. I urge the Biden transition team to reconsider this position.""
Asked about criticism from immigration reform advocates, Biden responded that ""I’ve never told them anything I haven’t’ done. I’m working with them now. We’re dealing with some of those organizations as we speak.""
BIDEN SAYS HE HASN'T DISCUSSED HIS SON HUNTER'S CONTROVERSY IN HIS SEARCH FOR AN ATTORNEY GENERAL
Immigration was a major topic during the long 2020 election cycle. Biden was criticized by some of his nomination rivals during the Democratic presidential primaries and by Trump during the general election for the rise in deportations during his tenure as vice president under President Obama. The Obama administration faced a surge of unaccompanied minors trying to enter the U.S. in 2014. Some immigration activists called Obama the ""deporter in chief"" at the time. 
Biden last month pledged to send to Congress in his first 100 days in office a bill that would offer a pathway to citizenship ""for over 11 million undocumented people.""

Pelosi, Schumer 'shenanigans' kept COVID aid from happening sooner: McConnell
Senate Majority Leader discusses what $900 billion package means for Americans, says vaccines ‘the only way’ to overcome pandemic.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., reportedly suggested over the weekend that she plans to make sure President Trump leaves the Oval Office one way or another, as he continues to suggest the 2020 election was won unfairly by his opponent Joe Biden.
As Pelosi engaged in discussions with other congressional leaders to hammer out both a coronavirus relief bill and a spending package to fund the U.S. government, the California Democrat told her team that she could not wait until Trump’s term had ended.
""I’m counting down the hours ‘til he’s gone,"" Pelosi told her leadership team over the weekend, as reported by Politico. ""I plan to pull him out of there by his hair, his little hands and his feet.""

A spokesperson for Pelosi did not return Fox News’ request for comment.
Lawmakers passed the $900 billion coronavirus relief bill on Monday night, which was subsequently sent to Trump’s desk for final approval on Tuesday.
The president urged lawmakers over the weekend to pass relief in a Twitter post, but has been otherwise heavily focused on alleged election fraud – less than one month ahead of Biden’s inauguration date.

President-elect Biden chose Connecticut's education commissioner and longtime public school teacher, Miguel Cardona, to serve as his education secretary on Tuesday.
Cardona, 45, worked as a public educator for two decades in Connecticut, before becoming the state’s top education official in 2019. 
As education commissioner, Cardona has been a vociferous advocate of sending children back to school for in-person learning amid the coronavirus pandemic, noting the low transmission rate among children and the devastating setbacks of remote learning. 
If confirmed, Cardona would be able to push for reopenings nationwide, as Biden has pledged to have most schools reopened by his 100th day in office. 
DEVOS PLEADS WITH EDUCATION DEPARTMENT STAFF TO 'BE THE RESISTANCE' 
Under the leadership of Cardona and Gov. Ned Lamont, Connecticut was a rare blue state to express a strict preference for in-person learning amid the rise and fall of coronavirus cases in the state. 
Ultimately, the decision was left to school districts to decide how to handle closings. In November, Cardona and acting Department of Health Commissioner Deidre Gifford sent a letter to local superintendents saying they do not think ""arbitrary, date-based closures of school are warranted at this time.""
Citing the social, emotional and physical benefits of classroom presence, the letter said ""in-person education is too important for our children to disrupt their education further, unless and until local conditions specifically dictate the need to do so.
""We are not seeing sustained person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 in schools or outbreaks of COVID-19 in schools, despite increasing levels of COVID-19 in the community,"" they wrote.
Meanwhile, as Biden, a self-described ""union guy,"" has called for eliminating federal funding of for-profit charter schools, some in his party, including Democrats for Education Reform, has criticized efforts to roll back federal funding for charter schools. They argue that doing so will cut off options for low-income Americans. 
Cardona has expressed support for charter schools, telling the Connecticut Post last year that it’s important for parents to have choices. ""As a parent myself I want to make sure I have options for my children,"" he said. 
Jeanne Allen, CEO of the Center for Education Reform, praised the choice of Cardona. 
""President-Elect Joe Biden’s choice of Connecticut Commissioner of Education, Miguel Cardona, is good news for the millions of parents and students... Had Biden picked a union leader or equivalent, it would have been akin to an act of war on the progress of the last three decades of pushing power to parents,"" she said in a statement. 
BIDEN SAYS SCHOOLS SHOULD REOPEN WITHIN FIRST 100 DAYS 
Cardona said he wants public, charter and magnet schools to all abide by the same accountability measures. Still, during his hearing for education commissioner, Cardona said his work would center on public schools. 
""Charter schools provide choice for parents that are seeking choice, so I think it’s a viable option, but [neighborhood schools] that’s going to be the core work that not only myself but the people behind me in the agency that I represent will have while I’m commissioner.""

Only about 10% of public school funding comes from the federal government, mostly through the Title I program, which goes to low-income schools.

Biden blasts Trump over suspected Russian cyberattack on fed agencies
FOX News correspondent Mark Meredith has the latest from Washington on 'Special Report'
President-elect Joe Biden is placing blame for the serious cyber hack of numerous federal government agencies and major companies on President Trump and pledged that ""we will respond"" when it’s determined which country is behind the damage. 
Biden on Tuesday called the cyberattack ""a grave risk and it continues. I’ve seen no evidence that it’s under control."" But he avoided answering whether he considers the attack an act of war.
HACKED NETWORKS WILL NEED TO BE BURNED 'DOWN TO THE GROUND'
In a pre-holiday address and in an question and answer session from his hometown of Wilmington, Del., the president-elect took aim at Trump.
""The truth is this, the Trump administration failed to prioritize cybersecurity,"" Biden argued. ""It did that from eliminating or downgrading cyber coordinators in both the White House and at the State Department, to firing the director of Cyberspace [Cybersecurity] and Infrastructure Security Agency, to President Trump’s irrational downplaying of the seriousness of this attack. Enough’s enough.""
 President-elect Joe Biden speaks at The Queen Theater in Wilmington, Del., Tuesday, Dec 22, 2020. (Associated Press) 
Biden highlighted that ""the attackers succeeded in catching the federal government off guard and unprepared.""
""This assault happened on Donald Trump’s watch when he wasn’t watching. It’s still his responsibility as president to defend American interests for the next four weeks. But rest assured that even if he does not take it seriously, I will,"" the president-elect vowed.
Biden said, ""athere’s still so much that we don’t know, including the full scope of the breach or the extend of the damage it has caused. But we know this much, this attack constitutes grave risk to our national security."" 
Biden noted that initial indications from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General William Barr are that ""Russia is responsible for this breach"" 
The president-elect emphasized that ""we can’t let this go unanswered. That’s means making clear and publicly who is responsible for the attack and taking meaningful steps to hold them to account.""
Biden stressed that ""the Trump administration needs to make an official attribution.""
""This was a very significant effort, and I think it's the case that now we can say pretty clearly that it was the Russians that engaged in this activity,"" Pompeo had said of the cyberhack in an interview Friday on the ""Mark Levin Show.""
POMPEO SAYS RUSSIANS ARE ‘PRETY CLEARLY’ BEHIND MAJOR CYBER ATTACK
But on Saturday, the president contradicted Pompeo as he downplayed the attack.
""The Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality. I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control,"" Trump tweeted. And he added that ""it may be China.""
The attack, which occurred over a period of several months starting earlier this year, zeroed in updates in widely used software from SolarWinds Corp., an Austin, Texas-based company.

Biden, answering reporter questions, said, ""When I learn the extent of the damage and in fact who is formally responsible, they can be assured we will respond and probably respond in kind.""
""I promise you there will be response,"" he repeated.
While he criticized Trump, Biden thanked members of Congress for speaking out immediately over the severity of the hack. The president elected said he was ""pleased to see leaders in both parties in the Congress speak out loudly and clearly on this attack. … I want to thank prominent Republicans in the Senate particularly for speaking out.""","foxnews.com","2020-12-22T22:58:40.000+00:00","https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-says-cyber-attack-happened-on-trumps-watch-when-he-wasnt-watching"

Texas congressman: Process on coronavirus stimulus bill was disgrace to taxpayers
Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, says it was a 'no-brainer' to oppose the massive coronavirus stimulus bill after lawmakers had little time to review more than 5,000 pages of new legislation.
Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, called it a ""no-brainer"" Tuesday to oppose the recently passed coronavirus relief package, calling the process behind its passage a disgrace to taxpayers.
After days of frenzied negotiations, Congress late Monday night passed a massive eleventh-hour bill that combined $900 billion in COVID-19 relief with a $1.4 trillion omnibus government spending measure.
Babin told ""America's Newsroom"" the process to pass the bill was ""a complete failure"" because due to its sheer length, lawmakers were given less than four hours to read all of the content, which came in at more than 5,000 pages. He was one of 53 House members to vote against it. 
WHY THESE 6 GOP SENATORS VOTED AGAINST CORONAVIRUS RELIEF PACKAGE
Babin said while no amendments nor any committee to review the final product was allowed, there were ""just a handful of members and their staff who gathered in secret to write a $2.3 trillion bill."" 
""The rest of us could take it or leave it ... I believe it was irresponsible to my constituents and the rest of the American taxpayers to vote on something of that magnitude,"" Babin said. ""So now we have it. It was done at the last minute behind closed doors, and as I said a second ago, that is not the way to run a railroad. And I just didn’t feel like it was a responsible thing for me to do to vote for that, and vote on something that I hadn’t read.""
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Democrats could have pushed a coronavirus relief package earlier, Babin said.
""Anyone who is on the other side of the aisle watching this program might say he is just blaming the Democrats. But listen, Ms. Pelosi and her team had every opportunity,"" Babin said.
Babin said that Republicans tried ""40 times"" to get Paycheck Protection Program support for small businesses.
""There was $137 billion still sitting there. We couldn’t touch it because she wouldn’t deal,"" Babin said.
HORSE RACING, THE DALAI LAMA AND SMOKEY BEAR: CORONAVIRUS RELIEF PACKAGE INCLUDES ODDBALL PROVISIONS
In addition to reviving a federal unemployment boost for millions of out-of-work Americans and sending a second $600 stimulus check to individuals, including children, the $2.3 trillion catchall package, which will fund the government for the remainder of the fiscal year, addresses a spate of legislation on taxes, energy, education and health care.
But the mammoth 5,593-page bill – part of an omnibus appropriations package that wraps 12 spending measures into one – also contains items that are not directly related to government funding or pandemic relief efforts, such as establishing two new branches of the Smithsonian museum near the National Mall, creating national standards for the horse-racing industry and making illegal streaming a felony.
Congress overwhelmingly passed the bill, which became available to lawmakers just a few hours before they were expected to vote on it — to the chagrin of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas.

""This is why Congress needs time to actually read this package before voting on it,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, linking to a story about the legislation making illegal streaming a felony. ""Members of Congress have not read this bill. It’s over 5000 pages, arrived at 2pm today, and we are told to expect a vote on it in 2 hours. This isn’t governance. It’s hostage-taking.""

On the roster: Sore-loserism stress test in Georgia - Senate rushes to override Trump veto of defense funds - Biden education pick sets up big fights - Newsom bows to Latino groups with Senate pick - The best dad bod 
SORE-LOSERISM STRESS TEST IN GEORGIA 
The Senate runoffs elections in Georgia that will conclude two weeks from today look like very close contests.
Polling for the Peach State’s November general election was pretty good on both the presidential and senatorial levels. What the same pollsters are finding this time around are very close contests in both races.
The averages in the races between Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler and their challengers, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, show a wafer-thin lead for the Democrats. But the real takeaway here is that this looks like a close call.
Now, we will point out that there is no good historical precedent for turnout expectations here. There have been two Georgia general election Senate runoffs before, and both were low-turnout boat races in which Republicans easily sailed into port. This time, though, turnout looks enormous and the state is tuned in like never before.
Unprecedented elections make polling harder, but certainly we can say that this is no safe harbor for Republicans.
Now imagine a very close outcome on Jan. 5, closer even than President-elect Joe Biden’s 11,779-vote victory last month. Now, further suppose that the control of the Senate hangs in the balance because either both results are very close or Democrats have clearly won one of the two seats.
It would be bad enough in any state in light of President Trump’s efforts to cling to power following his own defeat. Sore-loserism seems to have gone from a mortal political sin to something of a requirement – and there are practitioners in both parties.
Consider that Trump is spending the waning days of his presidency devoted to forcing a rupture in the GOP over his own preposterous claims of a landslide re-election. His targets include some of the people responsible for the successes for which Trump is constantly demanding more praise, Vice President Mike Pence, Attorney General Bill Barr and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
There’s no disagreement on ideas or policies here, just the fact that these guys won’t lie and say they believe Trump won the election when they do not and there is no evidence to support any such claim. But in Trump’s construction, it doesn’t matter whether you believe it, it just matters whether you think it might work.
Most telling is Trump’s attack on McConnell, whom the president argues owes him because Trump saved McConnell’s re-election in Kentucky this year. Let’s leave aside the fact that there’s no reason to think that’s true given McConnell’s track record of being in over-hyped but ultimately easily won races. If Trump really could claim to be McConnell’s benefactor rather than the other way around, what difference should that make? Should McConnell say what he doesn’t believe and do so to the detriment of his own party because he owes Trump? Apparently, yes.
But surely there could be no place worse than Georgia to put the post-kraken political reality through a stress test.
Certainly Georgia has suffered more than most states at the hands of Trump and his outrage mobs. While the president came after Republicans in other battleground states he lost, Georgia stands out. It’s probably because Georgia is the most Republican state Trump lost, meaning it had the most Republican officials for Trump to badger.
But sore-loserism is not new to Georgia.
Stacey Abrams played the part after her 2018 gubernatorial defeat at the hands of Brian Kemp. Abrams, like Trump, refused to accept her defeat and, like Trump, attributed her loss to systemic corruption when she could not provide evidence of actual fraud. 
Now, a couple of things were different with Abrams. First, her claims were not as goofy as Trump’s but second, they were rooted in allegations of racism and voter disenfranchisement. 
While Abrams was no Sidney Powell, she certainly got kid-glove treatment for her disobliging, selfish refusal to accept the results of the election. 
If it’s close in Georgia, you can certainly expect no abundance of good sportsmanship among the contestants. The pressure on candidates in both parties to try to overturn the election results in a close contest would be intense. 
Both sides claim their own dubious moral justifications for eroding confidence in the state’s sound electoral system for their own personal benefit… what fun. 
The first big test of how Americans will behave in the post-Trump era may be upon us even before Trump leaves the White House.

President Lincoln wrote back to Sherman…: ‘Many, many thanks for your Christmas-gift — the capture of Savannah.

SENATE RUSHES TO OVERRIDE TRUMP VETO OF DEFENSE FUNDS
Fox News: ""Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell remained on the Senate floor into the wee small hours of the morning Tuesday – long after the Senate passed the $900 billion pandemic relief package – and urged President Trump not to make good on his threat to veto the defense spending bill, but prepared the Senate's response. Earlier this month, the GOP-controlled Senate approved the $740 billion national defense bill despite Trump’s veto threat. Trump wants any National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to include the repeal of Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. The law provides legal protection for Big Tech companies. Trump has called the law a ‘serious threat to our ‘National Security & Election Integrity.’ Trump’s position on the veto threatens to divide Republicans in the Senate. The final vote in the Senate was 84-13, well beyond the two-thirds requirement to override a potential veto if Trump carried through on his threat to sink the legislation.""
Too long to read, virus relief included unrelated items - AP: ""The $900 billion pandemic relief package that was rushed through Congress Monday … was a bill too big to fail, and also too big to read. Delivering virus aid to the country required a leap of faith for lawmakers as they cast their votes, practically sight unseen, for a sprawling, 5,593-page bill that linked the pandemic aid with a $1.4 trillion annual spending bill to fund the government. … Also in the bill: hundreds of unrelated legislative items negotiated by leadership to win support from various constituencies. It includes extended tax breaks for the alcohol industry and motor speedways, comprehensive energy legislation, revised copyright rules, approval of two new Smithsonian museums and lessened penalties for the transportation of water hyacinths. There’s also an entire section on Tibet, including a statement of U.S. policy on how to determine the country’s next spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and the decriminalization of the use of the Swiss coat of arms.
A closer look at how party leaders sealed the deal - Politico: ""When the top four congressional leaders finally sat down after months of avoiding a meeting on coronavirus relief, things quickly grew heated. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer thought they were being lowballed. Two days before, a bipartisan Senate group looking to break the logjam split their $908 billion proposal into two pieces: $160 billion in state and local aid along with a liability shield, and a $748 billion spending bill without those two most contentious issues. … After so many months of inaction even as the virus raged, Washington’s top leaders had no spending target in common when they convened. McConnell had proposed several bills ranging from $500 billion to nearly $1 trillion, Pelosi and Schumer wanted $2 trillion or more and Mnuchin and Pelosi had talked about $1.8 trillion. Schumer said the ensuing discussions over total spending consumed a day and a half. After congressional leaders eventually signed off on a coronavirus relief deal totaling around $900 billion, McConnell argued he’d been right all along.""
Why these 6 GOP senators voted against coronavirus relief package - Fox News: ""Sens. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Ron Johnson, R-Wis., Mike Lee, R-Utah, Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Rick Scott, R-Fla., all stood firmly against the bill, which had been bundled with a $1.4 trillion spending bill to avoid a government shutdown. … Paul suggested that instead lawmakers should open the economy, cut obvious waste in the budget, and stop piling on debt for future generations. Likewise, Scott railed against what he believed was an unnecessarily expensive measure… Blackburn recognized that the legislation will accomplish a number of positive goals … but claimed it was not worth the steep cost. … Johnson warned that due to the lack of time to examine the lengthy bill, it could take weeks or months before lawmakers understand everything included in it. … Cruz and Lee also criticized the process of the legislation, with lawmakers having just hours to read several thousand pages.""
BIDEN EDUCATION PICK SETS UP BIG FIGHTS 
USA Today: ""President-elect Joe Biden is poised to nominate Miguel Cardona, the education commissioner of Connecticut, as secretary of the Department of Education, multiple media outlets reported, choosing a major proponent of reopening schools during the coronavirus pandemic. Cardona, 45, would lead Biden's goal to reopen all public schools in the first 100 days of his administration if confirmed by the U.S. Senate. His pick would also add another Latino to Biden's increasingly diverse Cabinet. The expected hire marks a rapid rise for Cardona, who has served as Connecticut's education chief for just 16 months after working as a public school educator for two decades in Meriden, Conn., which has a school system of just 7,459 students. … Cardona is not directly aligned with teachers unions or advocates of school choice in the nation's education policy wars. Both camps praised the potential selection.""
Progressives fume over key White House pick - Fox News: ""‘Sign now: No Deficit Hawks in the Biden Administration!’ read a petition promoted by the Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez-aligned Justice Democrats in November. It was in opposition to Bruce Reed, a longtime aide to President-elect Biden getting a spot in his administration. Reed, Biden's transition organization announced Tuesday, will be the president-elect's deputy chief of staff, one of the most powerful positions in a presidential administration. Reed was tapped along with a handful of others to senior posts in the Biden White House on Tuesday. … While progressives have scored some victories in getting their allies picked… there has been a stewing dissatisfaction with the direction of Biden's high-profile appointments. Reed being chosen for such a critical role is likely to increase that.""
Team Biden tries to manage left’s expectations on immigration - Fox News: ""Top officials for the incoming Biden administration are warning that some changes to President Trump’s immigration policies will ‘take time’ – and migrants should not expect the border to be ‘fully open’ right away. Susan Rice and Jake Sullivan, President-elect Joe Biden’s incoming domestic policy and national security advisers, respectively, told Spanish wire service EFE that changes to the U.S. immigration system won’t happen right away. ‘We will be able to take some steps to change policies right away,’ Rice said, in comments first reported by The Washington Post. ‘Others will take time to put in place, and the situation at the border will not transform overnight due in large part to the damage done over the last four years. But we are committed to addressing it in full.’""
Dems face a difficult electoral landscape - WaPo: ""Ultimately, President-elect Joe Biden won the contests that mattered most… But beneath the surface, despite low approval ratings, high unemployment and a raging pandemic whose handling he had fumbled, Trump’s strength grew among key parts of the electorate. Those warning signs have dampened the celebratory mood among Democrats enthusiastic about dispatching Trump. Party strategists now speak privately with a sense of gloom and publicly with a tone of concern as the election results become clearer. They worry about the potential emergence of a mostly male and increasingly interracial working-class coalition for Republicans that will cut into the demographic advantages Democrats had long counted on. They speculate that the tremendous Democratic gains in the suburbs during the Trump years might fade when he leaves office. And they fret that their inability to make inroads in more rural areas could forestall anything but the most narrow Senate majority in the future.""
NEWSOM BOWS TO LATINO GROUPS WITH SENATE PICK
WSJ: ""Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday named California Secretary of State Alex Padilla to fill the Senate seat being vacated by Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, giving the state its first-ever Latino senator. Ms. Harris, the second nonwhite senator elected to represent California, is set to vacate the seat when she takes higher office on Jan. 20 and Mr. Newsom had been under intense pressure to appoint a person of color to replace her. ‘Through his tenacity, integrity, smarts and grit, California is gaining a tested fighter in their corner who will be a fierce ally in D.C., lifting up our state’s values and making sure we secure the critical resources to emerge stronger from this pandemic,’ Mr. Newsom said of Mr. Padilla. Leaders in the Latino community had argued that the group’s sheer numbers—40% of the state’s population and growing—and the role its growth played in turning California solidly blue warranted a seat in the U.S. Senate.""

""This statement [Friday] immediately caught my attention, mostly the date: ‘When Edward Jenner performed the first vaccination in Gloucestershire, England in 1796.’ 1796 cannot be right for the first vaccination, unless it only counts if it went through some unknown bureaucratic process. My first thought was what about the Smallpox Vaccination that was done during the revolutionary war in the US? One Internet site talks about the first vaccination against smallpox took place 50 years earlier. Most credit George Washington with deciding to inoculate his troops and some claim this action may have been a deciding factor in the results of that revolution."" – Chris Haggerty, Winchester, Va.
[Ed. note: Certainly Washington, scarred by his own youthful bout with Smallpox, was a trailblazer on the subject. Not only did Continental camp life reflect Washington’s insistence on hygiene and quarantines, he even was known to have built units from those who had survived the pox and were immune for fighting with infected enemy units. In 1777, Washington took the step of intentionally exposing the whole army to a milder form of the disease – a practice called variolation that had been in use in the West for more than 50 years. In variolation, the patient’s arm is scratched or cut and then rubbed with a paste made from smallpox scabs from those already infected. Ewwwwwwwww. The goal is for the patient to actually get the disease but only a mild dose -- like moms having chicken pox parties. It saved many lives and was a great help to the war effort. But it was Jenner who was the first to use what we think of today as a vaccine -- an injection of a variant of the virus intended to trigger the immune response without producing an actual infection.]

THE BEST DAD BOD 
Reuters: ""A Canadian father endured painful hours under a tattoo needle to help his ‘self-conscious’ [8-year-old] son accept a birthmark on his torso. Edmonton-based Derek Prue Sr was inspired to get inked after noticing his son did not want to take off his shirt when he went swimming. ‘I knew he was self-conscious and that made me want just to show him that he wasn't the only one, like, we both have the same mark,’ Prue said. The inking was much more intense than he anticipated, he said. ‘It felt good to do it. It's a long process to do it. I thought it was going to be a few hours. It was, like, 30.’ Prue unveiled the surprise to his son, also named Derek, as he played in a hotel pool earlier this month. … The dad's red-wine colored tattoo covers part of his chest and belly and extends under his left arm.""

""The hyperbole that met [Trump’s] withdrawal from the Paris agreement — a traitorous act of war against the American people, America just resigned as leader of the free world, etc. — was astonishing, though hardly unusual, this being Trump.

President-elect Joe Biden said in a press conference Tuesday that his son Hunter’s business dealings had not come up in discussions about his highly anticipated pick for attorney general. 
""Has the issue of investigations with your son come up with your team and with candidates about (sic) attorney general?"" a reporter asked. 
""No, no I guarantee you I'm going to do what I said,"" Biden responded. ""The attorney general of the United States of America is not the president's lawyer. I will appoint someone I expect to enforce the law as the law is written, not guided by me.""
Shortly after, Biden was asked by Fox News’ Peter Doocy whether he thought previous stories regarding his son’s purported laptop were the work of ""Russian disinformation.""
RATCLIFFE SAYS HUNTER BIDEN EMAILS, LAPTOP 'NOT PART OF SOME RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN'
""Yes, yes, yes. God love ya, man. You are a one-horse pony. I tell ya. Thank you. thank you. I promise you my justice department will be totally on its own making its judgments about how to proceed,"" the president-elect said. 
The FBI is now in possession of the laptop purportedly belonging to Hunter Biden, which contained emails revealing his foreign business dealings, including contacts in Ukraine and China.
The FBI and Justice Department officials have concurred with acting-Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe that the laptop is not part of a Russian disinformation campaign targeting Biden.
The emails in question were first obtained by the New York Post and, in part, revealed that Hunter Biden allegedly introduced his father, the then-vice president, to a top executive at Ukrainian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings less than a year before he pressured government officials in Ukraine to fire prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was investigating the company’s founder. 
At the same time, Attorney General Bill Barr, who will conclude his service this week said Monday he has ""no plan"" to appoint a special counsel to take over the federal investigation into Hunter Biden’s tax affairs.
Republicans have demanded that a special counsel be appointed to continue the federal investigation into Hunter Biden to ensure that it continues through the incoming Biden administration. President Trump reportedly had been discussing a potential special counsel for that investigation. 
Hunter Biden confirmed earlier this month that he is under federal investigation for his ""tax affairs."" 
BARR ANNOUNCES RESIGNATION
A well-placed government source told Fox News that Hunter Biden has been a subject/target of the grand jury investigation.
The source said President-elect Biden is not a subject of any grand jury investigation at this time.
The source also told Fox News that this investigation was predicated, in part, by Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) regarding suspicious foreign transactions. Another source familiar with the investigation told Fox News the SARs were regarding funds from ""China and other foreign nations.""
The investigation, according to a source familiar with the matter, began in 2018. It predates Attorney General Bill Barr, who was confirmed in 2019. 
The inquiry could weigh on Biden’s potential pick for attorney general, after Biden has promised to restore the Justice Department’s independence from the White House. Some have called on Biden to appoint a special counsel to make any future decisions regarding his son, to distance both the White House and attorney general. 
Trump, before Barr's resignation, hit the attorney general, calling it a ""big disappointment"" that he knew about the federal investigation into his opponent's son and did not disclose it before Election Day. 
""Why didn’t Bill Barr reveal the truth to the public, before the Election, about Hunter Biden. Joe was lying on the debate stage that nothing was wrong, or going on - Press confirmed"" Trump tweeted last week. ""Big disadvantage for Republicans at the polls!""
Meanwhile, Biden has not yet said whether he’ll commit to keeping the Delaware U.S. attorney investigating Hunter Biden in his position in the new administration.

It’s standard for new presidents to ask for the resignation of all U.S. attorneys upon entering office, but given the conflict of interest, Fox News repeatedly asked the Biden transition team whether the president-elect would keep David Weiss, the U.S. attorney for Delaware, in his role until the investigation into Biden’s son’s taxes was complete.

Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, on Tuesday took aim at his own party, asking ""what purpose"" the Republican Party serves -- after he blasted its role in passing the mammoth omnibus spending bill.
""Genuine question - what purpose does the @GOP serve?"" he asked. ""Other than a voice (but not consistently) for the pro-life, and a voice of opposition generally to Dems... what good is it? Massive spending? Open borders? Endless wars? Federal healthcare/education?"" he tweeted.
FOREIGN AID IN YEAR-END SPENDING PACKAGE ATTACHED TO CORONAVIRUS AID CAUSES UPROAR
While he didn’t mention the omnibus specifically, it came after he had railed against both the bill and the legislative process behind it in a blistering statement -- calling it ""legislative malpractice.""
""This spending measure is nothing short of an embarrassment, and any justification for supporting it by members of Congress or the president requires deceptive contortions of the highest order,"" he said. ""It represents everything wrong with Washington and epitomizes the very swamp that the president supposedly ran against.""
CONGRESS HAD SIX HOURS TO READ A 6,000 PAGE BILL, AOC CALLS IT 'HOSTAGE TAKING'
""The president should veto the bill and force Congress back to the drawing board to do its job just as the American people do theirs every day,"" he said.
The omnibus was paired with a coronavirus stimulus bill in one fell swoop Monday night, many on both sides of the aisle objected to the process which essentially attached the crucial aid to other priorities totaling $2.3 trillion. 
Roy had named a ""slush fund"" for governors to allow them to keep schools closed, a cut to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) funding, and items like funding for gender programs in Pakistan as items he objected to in the legislation, as well as the limited time lawmakers got to read the 5,600-page bill.

The letter's point was one shared on the opposite end of the ideological spectrum to Roy, with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez protesting that lawmakers ""have not read this bill.""
""It’s over 5000 pages, arrived at 2pm today, and we are told to expect a vote on it in 2 hours,"" she tweeted. ""This isn’t governance. It’s hostage-taking.""

Omar shades fellow 'Squad' member AOC for getting COVID-19 vaccine before frontline workers
Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar slams lawmakers including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for getting coronavirus vaccines ahead of the elderly and frontline workers.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., took to social media this week to defend her decision to receive the coronavirus vaccine over the weekend, after some of her fellow lawmakers criticized members for accepting doses ahead of frontline workers and vulnerable populations.
In direct response to a tweet penned by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., Ocasio-Cortez laid blame on Republicans for instilling distrust about the vaccine into the American public, suggesting that she felt it would be hypocritical for leaders to urge the public to take a vaccine they weren’t taking themselves.
Paul said in his message that he thought it was ""inappropriate"" for someone like him, or Ocasio-Cortez, who either had immunity or were healthy and young, to accept a dose ahead of the elderly and health care workers.
Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., also took to Twitter to express her frustration with the process, deeming it ""shameful"" for lawmakers to be prioritized for the vaccine.
""We are not more important [than] frontline workers, teachers, etc. who are making sacrifices [every day],"" Omar wrote. ""Which is why I won’t take it. People who need it most, should get it.""
But many lawmakers have opted to sign up for a vaccination, some – like Ocasio-Cortez – with the purpose of showing the American public that the vaccine is safe and effective.
Ocasio-Cortez, for example, made herself available to social media users after her injection in order to answer pressing questions.
ILHAN OMAR SLAMS LAWMAKERS INCLUDING AOC FOR GETTING CORONAVIRUS VACCINES AHEAD OF ELDERLY, FRONTLINE WORKERS 
States are largely responsible for developing plans to make the vaccine available to residents over the coming months. Most have agreed to prioritize vulnerable populations, like nursing home residents and essential frontline workers, until doses are more widely available.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading expert on infectious diseases, recommended that leaders like President Trump and President-elect Joe Biden receive the vaccine as soon as possible for security and safety reasons.
Trump, who has not yet received his vaccine, previously said he thought White House staff should receive doses later in the program.
Trump contracted the virus in October, but it is not clear how long immunity lasts.
Vice President Mike Pence publicly received his vaccine at the White House on Friday, along with his wife, Karen Pence, and Surgeon General Jerome Adams.
Biden was vaccinated publicly on Monday, while Dr. Fauci received the Moderna vaccine on Tuesday.

President Trump is expected to veto the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) Wednesday, sources tell Fox News, forcing the House and Senate to reconvene immediately following Christmas.
Trump’s promise to veto the $740 billion defense package, which directs Pentagon funding and policy, will force Democrats and Republicans to attempt to override his ruling.
Trump has until Dec. 23 to veto the NDAA, which will force House members to reconvene on Dec. 28 to vote on the override. If they are successful in obtaining a two-thirds vote in favor of rejecting Trump’s veto, the Senate will then vote to override on Dec. 29, sources confirmed for Fox News.
MCCONNELL IMPLORES TRUMP NOT TO VETO DEFENSE BILL, PREPARES OVERRIDE EFFORT
The Senate will also need to achieve a two-thirds vote in favor of overriding the president. If successful this will be Congress’ first veto override during Trump’s presidency, as he prepares to leave office in less than one month.
The defense bill was approved by Congress with strong bipartisan support, passing in the House 335-78, and in the Senate 84-13 – making it likely Congress could override the president’s veto.
However, senators remain concerned that some GOP House members may choose not to counter the president’s decision.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has already said he would not vote in favor of overriding the veto, prompting one senator to tell Fox News that the consensus among senators on the chances of a successful House override is about 50-50.
Trump first promised to reject the defense bill earlier this month, after Congress omitted language on Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which the president has called ""a serious threat to our National Security & Election Integrity.""
The president has long sought to take on ""big tech,"" which he believes is unfairly protected by Section 230 and therefore allows conservative bias on social media platforms.
Section 230 provides legal protection for technology companies from content produced by third parties or users on social media in particular.
CLOCK TICKS CLOSER TO GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AS BITTERLY DIVIDED SENATE PUNTS VOTE TO FRIDAY
""I will Veto the Defense Bill, which will make China very unhappy. They love it,"" Trump tweeted Thursday. ""Must have Section 230 termination, protect our National Monuments and allow for removal of military from far away, and very unappreciative, lands. Thank you!""
The Senate could face its own challenges in getting an override vote successfully though before Jan. 3, when the 117th Congress will take office.
Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., pushed to stop the bill from passing through the Senate earlier this month, when he contested a measure in the legislation that would prevent the president from being able to unilaterally withdraw troops from war zones.
Paul blamed Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., and called her a ""neocon,"" saying her philosophy was ""substantiating war and making sure that it becomes and is perpetual war.""
""I’ve told them I’ll come back to try to prevent them from easily overriding the defense bill veto,"" Paul told reporters, pledging to do his best to prevent a successful override vote, reported Politico.
But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has urged Trump not to veto the measure and said Tuesday that he and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., are crossing party lines to get this defense spending package passed together.

""The Democrat leader and I have agreed to unanimous request as follows: the Senate will meet for pro forma sessions only until Dec. 29 when we will return to session,"" McConnell said, according to C-SPAN producer Craig Caplan.

Loeffler: Warnock and the left-wing media want to drive the country to socialism
Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., discusses her closely followed race in the Georgia Senate runoffs and responds to a New York Times article examining her upbringing and Wall Street background.
Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., said Tuesday she would not allow the ""left-wing media"" or her Democratic opponent, Rev. Raphael Warnock, to drive the country toward socialism.
""I've been blessed to live the American dream,"" Loeffler told ""Outnumbered Overtime"" in response to a lengthy New York Times article examining her upbringing, Wall Street background and staunchly pro-Trump voting record. 
""I was born and raised on a farm, grew up working in the fields, waitressed my way through school, and built a successful career, based on free enterprise,"" she added. ""That's what I'm fighting for. Democrats want to bring socialism to our country. Raphael Warnock would be a rubber stamp for socialism, and we're not going to let that stand ... The left-wing media wants to take us toward socialism, and we're not going to stand for that here in Georgia.""
The Times portrayed Loeffler as being cagey about her family's ""prosperous"" farming background and suggesting her successful Wall Street career contradicts her pitch as an advocate for hard-working Georgians. The article was not entirely negative, however, quoting people who described her as driven and professional.
WARNOCK'S FORMER GROUP, UNDER FRAUD INVESTIGATION, WAS PREVIOUSLY HIT WITH UNEMPLOYMENT TAX LIENS
The piece also delved into Loeffler's political transformation over the past decade. She has repeatedly touted her 100% voting record with President Trump, although she did not donate to him during his 2016 race. Loeffler, the wealthiest member of Congress, was a major bundler for Republican nominee Mitt Romney in 2012.
""We're fighting for the president because he's fought for us for four years, and he's continuing to fight for us,"" Loeffler said. ""We have been helping deliver relief under this pandemic, relief that the Democrats have blocked time and again, and David Perdue and I have done that every single day.""
Loeffler and Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., are the last hopes for Republicans to hold the U.S. Senate majority next year by winning their runoff races on Jan. 5. They have sought to nationalize the race by calling themselves a firewall against potential full Democratic control of Congress. 
HARRIS SAYS 'EVERYTHING IS AT STAKE' IN GEORGIA'S TWIN SENATE RUNOFF ELECTIONS
With so much on the line for both parties, the state has been flooded with top surrogates, including Trump, Vice Pesident Mike Pence and former ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley for the Republicans, and President-elect Joe Biden, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and former President Barack Obama for the Democrats.
Warnock and Perdue's challenger, Jon Ossoff, have attacked their Republican opponents over their support for Trump and their scrutinized stock transactions at the outset of the pandemic, although no wrongdoing has been proven.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp appointed Loeffler to fill Sen. Johnny Isakson's seat last year, and she took her position in January. She advanced to the runoff with Warnock after a ""jungle"" special election in November, and she has repeatedly lambasted him as a ""radical liberal"" who would be the first pro-Marxist senator if he won. She has particularly assailed his past rhetoric against the police.
""We are the firewall to stopping socialism in America, right here in Georgia,"" Loeffler said. ""We know that we have to hold the line. The American dream is on the ballot, and we know that because Chuck Schumer said he was going to take Georgia and change America ... If we don't hold the line here in Georgia, we will see the election of our first Marxist senator, and we can't let that happen.""","foxnews.com","2020-12-22T20:58:45.000+00:00","https://www.foxnews.com/politics/loeffler-georgia-warnock-media-socialism"

Omar shades fellow 'Squad' member AOC for getting COVID-19 vaccine before frontline workers
Democrat Rep. Ilhan Omar slams lawmakers including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for getting coronavirus vaccines ahead of the elderly and frontline workers.
A bipartisan group of lawmakers plans to delay getting the COVID-19 vaccine -- which became available to congressional leaders last week -- until all health care workers and people over the age of 65 have had a chance to receive it. 
TULSI GABBARD AND RASHIDA TLAIB ONLY HOUSE DEMS WHO VOTED AGAINST COVID RELIEF: HERE'S WHY
Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii; Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J.; Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.; and incoming Rep.-elect Nancy Mace, R-S.C.; indicated they believe it's inappropriate to receive the inoculation when so many front-line workers struggling to contain the spread of the virus still haven't.
Gabbard has urged her colleagues under the age of 65 to stand down. 
""I had planned to get the vaccine but will now stand in solidarity with our seniors by not doing so until THEY can. I urge my colleagues who are under 65 and healthy to join me,"" Gabbard said in a post on Twitter Monday. 
Meanwhile, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who is one of the youngest members of Congress at age 31, shared a video online of herself receiving the vaccine and explaining the procedure to her constituents. 
Fellow Squad member Omar, however, said getting the treatment before other essential workers would be ""shameful.""

Which is why I won’t take it. People who need it most, should get it. Full stop,"" Omar, whose father died of the coronavirus, said on Twitter.
Meanwhile, Paul, who contracted the virus and recovered, said it would be ""inappropriate for me -- who has already gotten the virus/has immunity -- to get in front of elderly/healthcare workers.""

Pence urges activists to ‘stay in the fight for election integrity’
Vice president speaks at Turning Point USA’s Student Action Summit in West Palm Beach, Fla.
Vice President Mike Pence claimed on Tuesday that the presidential election ""continues.""
Speaking in West Palm Beach, Florida at a Student Action Summit organized by Turning Point USA, a major pro-Trump and conservative youth advocacy group, the vice president urged the crowd ""to stay in the fight in our election.""
EXTREME MEASURES FLOATED AS ELECTION WAR DOMINATES TRUMP'S LAST DAYS IN OFFICE
""As our election contest continues, I’ll make you a promise, we’re going to keep fighting until every legal vote is counted. We’re going to keep fighting until every illegal vote is thrown out,"" Pence said, repeating a line he has used frequently as he has campaigned in recent weeks in the Georgia Senate runoff elections, where the Republican Senate majority’s at stake.

Pence’s appearance at the Turning Point USA summit came eight days after the Electoral College formalized President-elect Joe Biden’s victory over President Trump in last month’s general election.
But Trump refuses to concede to Biden as he continues to claim there was massive voter fraud in key battleground states where Biden beat him. On Monday, Trump and Pence met at the White House with a handful of top Trump supporters in the House of Representatives for a strategy session on how to protest the election results when a joint session of Congress meets on Jan. 6 to certify the Electoral College results.
Pence, in his role as president of the Senate, will preside over the session.
While Pence was flying to Florida on Tuesday, Trump tweeted, without offering any concrete evidence, that the presidential contest ""WAS A RIGGED ELECTION!!!""
Pence avoids such charges and language in his speeches and comments. Instead, he spent much of 30 minute address praising the president and his administration’s accomplishments the past four years. And he saluted Trump as ""the most pro-life president in American history.""
PENCE - IN GEORGIA - VOWS THAT HE AND TRUMP WILL 'KEEP FIGHTING'
The vice president told the crowd that ""with your support, President Trump and our team received more than 74 million votes across America."" But he omitted that Biden won a record breaking 81 million votes in the presidential election.
Pence also highlighted that ""we flipped 12 seats in the United States Congress and the president actually received the greatest share of minority votes for a Republican in 60 years.""
His comments sparked chants of ""four more years"" and ""stop the steal"" by the audience.
But in an indirect acknowledgement that the Trump administration would be coming to a close on Jan. 20 with Biden’s inauguration as president, Pence asked the crowd to ""stay in the fight to defend all that we’ve done.""

The AP reported that Birx was accompanied by three generations of her family from two households, despite her telling others to stay in their immediate household.
Birx insisted that she did not travel to Delaware to celebrate Thanksgiving, but rather to prepare her home there for a sale and her travel companions were from her immediate household.

Will the media miss Trump?
Hostile relationship constantly makes news
As 2020 comes to a close, the news has been dominated by a global pandemic, statewide lockdowns and a presidential election. Amid all that, it’s easy to forget about political events, including scandals and controversies, that otherwise would have been more in the spotlight.
Here are the top political scandals of 2020:
Trump’s impeachment trial
The Ukraine controversy led to President Trump’s impeachment at the end of 2019 in the House of Representatives. But the matter raged on into early 2020.
The saga, involving Trump’s July 25, 2019, call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump urged him to investigate the Biden family’s dealings in the country, had led to two articles of impeachment. Those articles accused the president of abuse of power and obstruction, respectively.
SENATE ACQUITS TRUMP ON ABUSE OF POWER, OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS CHARGES
But it was always an unlikely prospect for a conviction in the Republican-controlled Senate, and that ended up being the case – the Senate voted for Trump’s acquittal on both counts.
However, the topic of the call – Hunter Biden’s business dealings – would resurface later in the year.
John Bolton’s allegations
Former National Security Adviser John Bolton made headlines in the summer when he released a book, ""The Room Where It Happened,"" alleging Trump backed the idea of more concentration camps in China and asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to help him in the 2020 election.
Bolton accused the president of soliciting foreign election help during a June 29, 2019, meeting with Xi in Osaka, Japan.
""Trump then, stunningly, turned the conversation to the coming U.S. presidential election, alluding to China’s economic capability and pleading with Xi to ensure he’d win,"" Bolton wrote. ""He stressed the importance of farmers and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome.""
BOLTON ACCUSES TRUMP OF 'OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE AS A WAY OF LIFE,' ASKING CHINA'S XI FOR 2020 HELP
The president then allegedly urged China to ""buy as many American farm products as China could,"" Bolton wrote, and ""Xi agreed that we should restart the trade talks, welcoming Trump’s concession that there would be no new tariffs and agreeing that the two negotiating teams should resume discussions on farm products on a priority basis,"" Bolton wrote.
Trump advisers would deny the allegations in the tell-all book.
Nancy Pelosi’s hair salon visit
As states initiated severe coronavirus restrictions, a number of lawmakers were accused of hypocrisy and for not following restrictions they either enacted or supported.
Perhaps the most high-profile was when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., visited a San Francisco hair salon in September for a wash and blowout, despite local ordinances keeping salons closed amid the coronavirus pandemic.
PELOSI USED SHUTTERED SAN FRANCISCO HAIR SALON FOR BLOW-OUT, OWNER CALLS IT 'SLAP IN THE FACE' 
In footage obtained by Fox News, Pelosi was seen walking through ESalonSF in San Francisco with wet hair, and without a mask over her mouth or nose.
The stylist doing her hair could be seen following her wearing a black face mask.
Salons in San Francisco had been closed since March and were notified Sept. 1 they could reopen for outdoor hairstyling services only.
""It was a slap in the face that she went in, you know, that she feels that she can just go and get her stuff done while no one else can go in, and I can’t work,"" the salon owner told Fox News at the time.
When asked for comment, Pelosi’s office maintained that the speaker was following the rules as presented to her.
""The speaker always wears a mask and complies with local COVID requirements. This business offered for the speaker to come in on Monday and told her they were allowed by the city to have one customer at a time in the business. The speaker complied with the rules as presented to her by this establishment,"" a spokesperson said at the time.
Eric Swalwell and the alleged Chinese spy
Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., came under scrutiny in December after an Axios report that revealed an alleged Chinese spy named Christine Fang, or Fang Fang, had ties to a number of political figures, including Swalwell – and allegedly had sexual interactions with at least two Midwestern mayors.
According to the Axios report, Fang and Swalwell had been linked since his days as a Dublin City, Calif., council member, prior to his election to Congress in 2012. She had helped fundraise for his 2014 campaign and placed at least one intern in his office, Axios' reporting found.
SWALWELL REFUSES TO ANSWER FOX NEWS QUESTIONS ON RELATIONSHIP WITH SUSPECTED CHINESE SPY 
Investigators reportedly gave Swalwell a defensive briefing in 2015, and he cut ties with Fang soon after.
""Rep. Swalwell, long ago, provided information about this person – whom he met more than eight years ago, and whom he hasn’t seen in nearly six years – to the FBI,"" Swalwell's office told Axios. They added that Swalwell ""will not participate"" in the story out of concerns about possible classified information.
But Republicans have raised questions about the connection, and House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called for him to be removed from the House Intelligence Committee.
Trump’s photo outside a DC church
During the nationwide protests in the wake of the death of George Floyd, protesters descended on Washington, D.C. – with some protests turning violent.
Trump visited St. John’s Episcopal Church, which had been previously attacked by vandals, moments after he addressed the nation and promised to restore ""law and order"" amid the protests and riots that had engulfed the country in the aftermath of the death of Floyd, a Minneapolis man who died while in police custody.
Video
As Trump did so, protesters were being pushed back by riot police near Lafayette Square. Media outlets connected the pushback with Trump’s visit, expressing outrage over the smoke used – and describing the protesters as ""peaceful.""
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., accused Trump of ""stoking tensions"" and said it was ""an action worthy of censure.""
Hunter Biden controversy re-emerges
The questions surrounding Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine, China and elsewhere, which had contributed to the impeachment of President Trump, emerged again in October when the New York Post reported on emails contained on a server purportedly belonging to Joe Biden’s son – and reported that he introduced the elder Biden to a Ukrainian businessman.
Video
That server, as well as revelations from his former business partner, Tony Bobulinksi, raised more questions about Hunter Biden's business dealings – including how much the former vice president knew about them.
The controversy did not sink Joe Biden’s presidential chances, but they emerged once again after the election – with Hunter announcing that he is under federal investigation for his ""tax affairs.""

A well-placed government source told Fox News that Hunter Biden has been a subject/target of the grand jury investigation. It is a controversy that could very easily linger on into 2021. However, Attorney General William Barr said he will not be appointing a special counsel to investigate.
""I think to the extent that there's an investigation, I think that it's being handled responsibly and professionally,"" Barr said.
